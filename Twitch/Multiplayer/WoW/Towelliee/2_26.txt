[2019-02-26 12:59:34 UTC] kappora: its a fact

[2019-02-26 13:01:32 UTC] pojotmc: @Towelliee the only sales data people have atm are physical box sales. Which are becoming increasingly irrelevant to actually determine anything meaningful.
[2019-02-26 13:01:40 UTC] hilariousmax: @Towelliee I know you've had zero time what with Anthem but have you gotten around to seeing True Detective Season 3 ?

[2019-02-26 13:16:11 UTC] literalzero: @TrickHurts It wasnt just wow, it was customer support and other non dev, also it wasnt the CEO, it was the CMO

Wild Star. Even if 2 players play a game, its not dead. It just isnt played as much as it was back in the day. Counter Strike 1.6 is even played to this day. Diablo 3 is still played to this day, they are all not dead until noone plays it anymore or cant play it anymore

[2019-02-26 13:20:28 UTC] armdel: This ain't Anthem DansGame
[2019-02-26 13:20:29 UTC] phaeten: Even then, those same streamers that raise hell about the current state of the game come running right back as soon as a new expansion hits.
[2019-02-26 13:20:34 UTC] efcon: But Dreanor looks awesome.

[2019-02-26 13:21:31 UTC] thoreya: Why doesn’t anthem have more viewers
[2019-02-26 13:21:34 UTC] cowee12356995: @trickhurts if they do what they claim then the restructuring will be a good thing imo. getting rid of bloat in their company and non development positions and then hiring more developers may end up being a long term win for us gamers SeemsGood

[2019-02-26 13:22:39 UTC] theunagiroll: im weirded that hearthstone isnt a WoW minigame instead of its own game and they have pet-battles instead
[2019-02-26 13:22:40 UTC] kevi_wow: @Towelliee bought anthem based on watching you play it and damn what an awesome game, needs some work but very enjoyable so far.
[2019-02-26 13:22:43 UTC] warrenny: Order halls were awesome

[2019-02-26 13:23:38 UTC] konradgm: oder halls were awesome, garrisons only problem with them were that they was not enough customization and they themselves took too much from game itself when it comes to crafting etc
[2019-02-26 13:23:46 UTC] levelupkent: People cry for new stuff so blizzard makes new stuff and then people hate the new stuff so blizzard guts it and then people hate whats left of all the stuff they wanted but always hated. The cycle continues

[2019-02-26 13:25:10 UTC] justsmooth: Blizzard would benefit from an annual pulse survey sent to every active account, in-game, where they ask for feedback and satisfaction levels.

[2019-02-26 13:25:27 UTC] trickhurts: Wasn’t wod a bad expansion because they had to go through and manually number squish all items after mop. So it took away from the actual expansion @towelliee

[2019-02-26 13:26:04 UTC] oldrektone: Blackrock Foundry is a nice Gold Farm. So I still have my Garrison hearthstone. lol

[2019-02-26 13:35:36 UTC] mizuryo: FeelsBadMan already forgetting the diablo franchise
[2019-02-26 13:35:36 UTC] bodisius: I think they could do housing somewhat like eso where there's houses themed with the zone and they're instanced
[2019-02-26 13:35:37 UTC] cramerr: 20%
[2019-02-26 13:35:39 UTC] silvikian: They catch you the same way they catch illegal keyboard/mouse macros. Cast times and what not. If ever time you cast a spell there is a 100ms delay perfect between them then you’d running a macro. If you cast, catch a fish, retrieve, then recast 100ms after you catch you’re running a bot

[2019-02-26 15:30:53 UTC] drelnar: anyways, masterpiece games like Witcher 3 or God of War that deserve 9 or 10 come out every 2-3 years :) gotta deal with those "shitty" games in the mean time @Towelliee :P

[2019-02-26 15:31:00 UTC] sulfoniclol: yes

[2019-02-26 15:31:09 UTC] loldotcom: 100%
[2019-02-26 15:31:11 UTC] stawnchy: @xVenomSymbiote Not a chance
[2019-02-26 15:31:17 UTC] tekneek007: abandoned and DLC plot released in a novel
[2019-02-26 15:31:20 UTC] the_crystal_undead: Andromedas got Abandoned Like a dog on the side of a road
[2019-02-26 15:31:24 UTC] sulfoniclol: for multiplayer
[2019-02-26 15:31:27 UTC] sharie: Bioware just Abandoned it still salty about it
[2019-02-26 15:31:28 UTC] steadmoh190: it was a single player game so you probably didnt play it
[2019-02-26 15:31:29 UTC] kikagam: for both i dont have time just need one.. but im not sure what.. ;D (im at ps4) yeah beta soon i was at anthem beta and i like it and d2 closed beta and i like it too.. :D
[2019-02-26 15:31:35 UTC] creepersama: Remember people, Battlefront 2 got shat on by media. BUT they are still releasing MORE CONTENT and still fixing bugs
[2019-02-26 15:31:41 UTC] creepersama: @Towelliee ^ yeah online
[2019-02-26 15:31:44 UTC] loldotcom: it was a garbo story, and didn't even hold a candle to the other ME games FeelsBadMan
[2019-02-26 15:31:45 UTC] xvenomsymbiote: this game can get game of the year after another patch
[2019-02-26 15:31:48 UTC] heatinup: got lego flame thrower/lightning coil last night. Worth over tom hanks build?
[2019-02-26 15:31:51 UTC] lugzgaming: well Open Beat for D2 is coming soon so just try both and see which you'll like
[2019-02-26 15:31:51 UTC] danielthemedic: i've been playing andromeda and like it so far
[2019-02-26 15:31:56 UTC] its_hekks: @CreeperSama and it is still a terrible game
[2019-02-26 15:31:57 UTC] piffes: just saw thicc bois can use flamethrower whislt flying if you pop coil first - looks fun :)
[2019-02-26 15:31:58 UTC] sharie: Mass Effect is still one of my Favorite Series
[2019-02-26 15:32:09 UTC] widehard_got_7: battlefront 2 had so many hackers sniping me from accross the map i literally couldnt even see them and i was getting hit
[2019-02-26 15:32:10 UTC] robbdadom: @synkhe I just find it funny he was sitting there bashing it and then well when I was playing last night .....
[2019-02-26 15:32:13 UTC] realmchicken: @xVenomSymbiote I doubt that, when Apex Legends took off as hard as it did.
[2019-02-26 15:32:18 UTC] efcon: Trump got shat on by media. It is just one point of view that not very representative.
[2019-02-26 15:32:20 UTC] creepersama: @its_hekks clearly, you haven't spent time playing it; coz it's still fun
[2019-02-26 15:32:20 UTC] steadmoh190: they are working on the new dragon age game now
[2019-02-26 15:32:21 UTC] xvenomsymbiote: battlefront 2 is still around because its star wars
[2019-02-26 15:32:23 UTC] synkhe: Andromeda , while not perfect or great was still decent, the issue was continuing Mass Effect itself whent he story was over
[2019-02-26 15:32:26 UTC] literalzero: exactly what i did
[2019-02-26 15:32:26 UTC] trinkasap: 144 viewers on battlefront 2
[2019-02-26 15:32:28 UTC] klaatuzu: @towelliee have you seen amazons new world mmo gameplay?
[2019-02-26 15:32:31 UTC] trinkasap: "around"
[2019-02-26 15:32:32 UTC] flyingsloppyjoe: andromeda was the battlestar galactica of mmo's.
[2019-02-26 15:32:35 UTC] its_hekks: @CreeperSama fun is subjective its a terrible game
[2019-02-26 15:32:36 UTC] cipherzone: Raining Purps
[2019-02-26 15:32:50 UTC] zadwanaa: Yeah, if you're debating between both anthem & Division 2... Check out open beta or watch a LOT of streams. Maybe D2 isn't the best on release...
[2019-02-26 15:32:51 UTC] blvdman: Anyone in chat know if its worth getting the oirigin premier for 1 month to try out anthem b4 buying ?
[2019-02-26 15:32:52 UTC] lugzgaming: From my understanding Destiny 2 had a very rough launch and now a year later it's fucking amazing and is close to becoming my main game. No reason the same can't happen for Anthem
[2019-02-26 15:32:59 UTC] xvenomsymbiote: @realmchicken Apex legends is a great game though
[2019-02-26 15:33:02 UTC] stixxerz: @Towelliee u made me try out the colosus
[2019-02-26 15:33:10 UTC] stixxerz: hope i gonna like it
[2019-02-26 15:33:21 UTC] creepersama: @its_hekks and your opinion of it being a terrible game is subjective... that just makes this "discussion" null and utterly waste of time...
[2019-02-26 15:33:24 UTC] danielthemedic: i like interceptor class
[2019-02-26 15:33:27 UTC] synkhe: @LugzGaming I've got the season pass for D2 (I am not smart, haha) and while it is a much improved game over launch, I still have no reason to play it
[2019-02-26 15:33:28 UTC] kisswani123: Bioware still has a special place in my heart , Dragon Age and Mass effect are one of my favourite series , only games i enjoyed besides WoW
[2019-02-26 15:33:34 UTC] robbdadom: All these people saying how Grindy it is apparently never played mhw
[2019-02-26 15:33:35 UTC] biscuitness: The New World...
[2019-02-26 15:33:48 UTC] realmchicken: @robbdadom HEHEH
[2019-02-26 15:34:06 UTC] steadmoh190: did you play destiny 2 @Towelliee
[2019-02-26 15:34:10 UTC] its_hekks: @CreeperSama no, the massive drop off in players and its proverbial non existance these days speaks for itself... its a terrible game
[2019-02-26 15:34:13 UTC] saldra740206: the grind is part of the game imo
[2019-02-26 15:34:13 UTC] synkhe: @LugzGaming Let alone the fact I am only 540ilvl so I can't even do any of the new content in the game and will need to grind for weeks to get to 600
[2019-02-26 15:34:29 UTC] robbdadom: I put 400 hrs into fighting the same monsters
[2019-02-26 15:34:30 UTC] toastmask: If you ain't first you're last!
[2019-02-26 15:34:53 UTC] zadwanaa: @Kisswani123 Dragon Age origins will always be one of my favorites... everything afterthat... its been disappointing... DA:3 was substantially better than DA:2, but nothing compared to DA:Origins ( PURELY My opinion )
[2019-02-26 15:35:02 UTC] kami5671: Why are you still playing this
[2019-02-26 15:35:03 UTC] pandanakin: big man with a gun
[2019-02-26 15:35:05 UTC] elleyfoxx: gotta enjoy that grind... just like when you wit' a man ;)
[2019-02-26 15:35:10 UTC] germanbacon: thats like only playing LFR and complaining that WoW is too easy
[2019-02-26 15:35:10 UTC] swervity82: @towelliee I just joined what happens in 28 days
[2019-02-26 15:35:10 UTC] widehard_got_7: BabyRage i killed a titan and only a blue dropped this game sucks BabyRage
[2019-02-26 15:35:14 UTC] drelnar: that's the whole point of the game, if you find grind boring, it's not a bad game, it's just not for you so man up ! :P
[2019-02-26 15:35:14 UTC] eva_unit_zero: That would be like saying playing the sims is to buildy
[2019-02-26 15:35:14 UTC] camarac: yeah 100% is too low

[2019-02-26 15:35:21 UTC] kisswani123: @Zadwanaa i agree , could do without inquisition but yeah Origin is too good
[2019-02-26 15:35:23 UTC] sharie: one of IGN Negatives about AC Black Flag was "too much Water" i mean its a Pirate game...
[2019-02-26 15:35:25 UTC] steadmoh190: nothing new in wow?
[2019-02-26 15:35:28 UTC] scorpiris_junoh: lol
[2019-02-26 15:35:30 UTC] lugzgaming: @Synkhe fair enough. Personally I'm looking forward to the grind. WoW is no longer a game I like to sink my teeth into and Destiny 2 is a great replacement so far
[2019-02-26 15:35:31 UTC] terren15: !anthem

[2019-02-26 15:35:41 UTC] biscuitness: Playing the sims is about creating a pool and drowining your family.
[2019-02-26 15:35:41 UTC] creepersama: @its_hekks just because it's not streamed on twitch doesn't mean that it is non-existent. Otherwise, they would have scrapped the game and wouldn't be updating it consistently. What evidence are you even using?
[2019-02-26 15:35:42 UTC] blvdman: @Towelliee would you recommend buying origin premiur just to test out anthem? or does that even work?
[2019-02-26 15:35:45 UTC] loldotcom: playing the sims is too irl4me FeelsBadMan

[2019-02-26 15:36:27 UTC] creepersama: @Towelliee Have they fixed the luck bug beyond 100%?
[2019-02-26 15:36:28 UTC] joeyshades101: Stats
[2019-02-26 15:36:31 UTC] piffes: just saw thicc bois can use flamethrower whislt flying if you pop coil first - looks fun :)
[2019-02-26 15:36:32 UTC] synkhe: Premeire is a solid value, shouldn't just be paying for it for one game
[2019-02-26 15:36:36 UTC] pheonixlite: Negativity gets views that’s why they are harping on it
[2019-02-26 15:36:36 UTC] biscuitness: For $5 you get 10 hours of several games too, so even less commitment than $15 lol
[2019-02-26 15:36:39 UTC] lugzgaming: Madden and BF5 make the $15 worth it without even including Anthem
[2019-02-26 15:36:43 UTC] zadwanaa: Thats where all you rluck went.. into getting gear with luck
[2019-02-26 15:36:46 UTC] doctaytay: how can i cash out the twitch stocks? Kappa
[2019-02-26 15:36:50 UTC] kryentv: so Luck increases chance of getting luck gear it seems ;)
[2019-02-26 15:36:52 UTC] the_crystal_undead: BF5 got too much hate
[2019-02-26 15:37:01 UTC] executeru: im not hating towlie, but is this game dead : i think they fked up a lot releasing it during apex hype
[2019-02-26 15:37:04 UTC] stoictaurus: No matter if Anthem success or fail .. EA wins with promoting their EA Access to so many people to try.
[2019-02-26 15:37:09 UTC] k1llb0t: imagine luck stat just increases drop rate of luck items LUL
[2019-02-26 15:37:10 UTC] biscuitness: Fifa is also supposed to be a major part of that too (but I don't play that)

[2019-02-26 15:37:32 UTC] syitias: different class
[2019-02-26 15:37:40 UTC] triplestruck: @the_crystal_undead it was well deserved, the game is the worstint he series
[2019-02-26 15:37:42 UTC] robbdadom: @elyseums I see the difference
[2019-02-26 15:37:42 UTC] ascendor81: I got 2 legendaries 3 days ago, before they nerfed the drop rate.
[2019-02-26 15:37:43 UTC] zadwanaa: @aceospades1 hahahahaha
[2019-02-26 15:37:43 UTC] biscuitness: @StoicTaurus - EA is focused on EA Premiere Access. That's why they've been fucking with release dates with tihings like Anthem, BF5, etc
[2019-02-26 15:37:46 UTC] lugzgaming: And I THINK Origin Access members get some sort of Apex in game currency. But I may be wrong.
[2019-02-26 15:37:47 UTC] piffes: just saw thicc bois can use flamethrower whislt flying if you pop coil first - looks fun :)
[2019-02-26 15:37:52 UTC] stawnchy: @executeru does it fucking matter? Do you want to play it or not.... A game is not arbritrarily 'dead' because of community being a bunch of haters

[2019-02-26 15:42:18 UTC] executeru: @TripleStrucK i agree with u i found it really fun when i played beta, im just talking about it being pricy. PLUS EA lets us down 10/10 times, its hard to trust something they release and also i think this game could do well if they didnt release when apex released

[2019-02-26 15:43:40 UTC] executeru: @Synkhe probably, but they could delay apex for 1 week imo, so the streamers started the hyhpe and buss about this
[2019-02-26 15:43:41 UTC] daihenka: @Towelliee The alliance stuff we don't get until the 26th Feb
[2019-02-26 15:43:42 UTC] royduran: the more you play with people the more your alliance xp goes up, and the more coin you get on monday i think
[2019-02-26 15:43:51 UTC] royduran: but i dont think its in effect?
[2019-02-26 15:44:01 UTC] lugzgaming: @Synkhe see I think EA should've delayed the release of Anthem a bit. Maybe towards end of summer. So many issues could've been fixed and the Apex hype wave would've died down a bit so less internal competition.

[2019-02-26 15:46:43 UTC] executeru: @Towelliee idk i think they knew because if u play apex once u can feel how good thge game is
[2019-02-26 15:46:51 UTC] biscuitness: They probably thought it was going to be a slower burn, but with how fast people consume BRs, it's not entirely unexpected for a new F2P one that's polished to do well. Esp, without cutesy graphics
[2019-02-26 15:46:56 UTC] sonny_b: I think they said you will have to pay for new javelins

[2019-02-26 16:11:30 UTC] budlesss: also there was a post about improvement on loot
[2019-02-26 16:11:32 UTC] blackesthate: @Towelliee This game.. So funny how Devs told us the abilities of our javelin is the most important damage part. However at GM 1-2-3 it's almost no use to use them, as gun's are the most powerful FailFish
[2019-02-26 16:11:36 UTC] pmanofwar: Is that a Big Chungus i see!
[2019-02-26 16:11:37 UTC] budlesss: they said they are aware or w.e

[2019-02-26 16:12:17 UTC] budlesss: abilitys are the most important

[2019-02-26 16:13:13 UTC] budlesss: thus IMPORTANT
[2019-02-26 16:13:17 UTC] zadwanaa: @BlackestHate only if you're colossus... autocannons are OP. comboing up your damage is truckloads better than skills
[2019-02-26 16:13:35 UTC] pilusmedicus: i think this is another case of EA pushing to release a game when its not finished

[2019-02-26 16:13:53 UTC] royduran: @Zadwanaa no point in explaning. that kid probably watched one youtube video of a broken gun like gunslinger and thinks the whole game is like that

[2019-02-26 16:14:37 UTC] thejipocalypse: @zadwanaa I agree this game isn’t for everyone. I think it would be badass if they added sockets to gear and had something similar to runes (Diablo 2) that you could loot and insert
[2019-02-26 16:14:44 UTC] zadwanaa: @BlackestHate you have one of the absolute best combos... i.. im sorry, enjoy the game man
[2019-02-26 16:14:45 UTC] blackesthate: @Zadwanaa Also i am talking about grandmaster 1-2-3 not any other difficulty levels
[2019-02-26 16:14:59 UTC] timbehi: this game could be amazing. But they just had to release it too early

[2019-02-26 16:15:03 UTC] centigrade: @BlackestHate Depends on your build.. but the typical Ranger combo is to melee until electrical primer is applied, then use grenade to detonate
[2019-02-26 16:15:09 UTC] danielthemedic: this is diablo with guns

[2019-02-26 16:44:34 UTC] mrgrumpleton: @Towelliee sadly most YT indy game review channels have turned SJW and just look for the hate clicks, very few actually objective reviewers lately.
[2019-02-26 16:44:49 UTC] dragonofwolves: I have never taken Angry Joe seriously ever
[2019-02-26 16:44:53 UTC] aethn: Althouigh I do miss getting inline at midnight for a game release, the social aspect of it. Its like a nerd/Geek orgasim with everyone congragating at midnight for a game

[2019-02-26 16:45:31 UTC] znza: ignorant as fuck lol, plus his points on those 2 videos were lame af. He can have his opinions but man i don't think he can enjoy anygame with the points he made
[2019-02-26 16:45:34 UTC] knocx: isnt that what most wow streamers do now?
[2019-02-26 16:45:36 UTC] maliguswow: @Towelliee Tell them everything in life is speculative
[2019-02-26 16:45:37 UTC] flappyurf: @MorteDeAngelis @MrGattz i understand, but like, I also generally don't like how EA conducts business (like SW games, etc) but this game is not bad... they won't be less for admitting it :D
[2019-02-26 16:45:38 UTC] scorilo: Angry Joe is kind of a satire show, i doubt it was meant to be taken seriously
[2019-02-26 16:45:38 UTC] vrtnipatuljak: flappyurf lots of reasons. its made by EA, voted worst company several times. its basically in early access since it launched with only chapter 1 and 3 boss fights. the bioware story they promote isnt really there, choices have 0 consequence
[2019-02-26 16:45:57 UTC] 91niki: Wtf LUL

[2019-02-26 16:46:21 UTC] bgwings: basically like this yes LUL
[2019-02-26 16:46:22 UTC] flappyurf: @VrtniPatuljak yeah, that's why I'm saying: for 60 bucks it's not that good deal, but the game is not shit or my definition of shit is something else entirely :D
[2019-02-26 16:46:24 UTC] zirpatty: cause im level 7 now LuL
[2019-02-26 16:46:26 UTC] krayzeetoucan: owens still a nice guy at level 7 Kappa
[2019-02-26 16:46:33 UTC] utmostownage: or people that played the 10 hour trial and say there is nothing to do LUL
[2019-02-26 16:46:41 UTC] vrtnipatuljak: flappyurf yeah its not shit, its just mediocre
[2019-02-26 16:46:43 UTC] ezekyler: at level 7 you only have 1 javelin unlocked lol
[2019-02-26 16:46:43 UTC] lsu389: level 8 or so was when you hit that Tombs mission initially. Pretty sure that's when a lot of people wrote the game off.
[2019-02-26 16:46:44 UTC] lotus0416: there's gonna be a raid right?
[2019-02-26 16:46:50 UTC] radas31: 30 hours in the game, still playing, still having fun with it and i think the angryjo review was on point.
[2019-02-26 16:46:54 UTC] mrdubhead: this one is nice to shields :D
[2019-02-26 16:46:56 UTC] archangelmd: amen! the guts with smh and not even making it to 30 and messing with end game
[2019-02-26 16:47:00 UTC] sketchsquadttv: <3
[2019-02-26 16:47:02 UTC] coaa85: how much luck do you have. If 1-2 pieces then yeah minor diff
[2019-02-26 16:47:04 UTC] adorablemalcontent: I love first loading Anthem and it says I am Level 1, until I view/enter a Javelin then pop back to Level 30. Just a UI bug I assume. Ha.
[2019-02-26 16:47:08 UTC] 91niki: It is like, just because you don't like a game, doesn't mean you should go ahead and shit all over it . We all have different opinions. Some people like sushi, some people don't . We don't scream at people on the street because we differ taste LUL
[2019-02-26 16:47:13 UTC] phantom_wulfstan: yeah that was PC gamer iirc?
[2019-02-26 16:47:31 UTC] thejipocalypse: @towelliee I’m ready to fight those blue mothers that we saw under the sheet in the last mission
[2019-02-26 16:47:31 UTC] utmostownage: is luck still broken over 100%?
[2019-02-26 16:47:32 UTC] archangelmd: guys* why release a review when you clearly haven't played the whole game. those guys were the worst
[2019-02-26 16:47:37 UTC] vrtnipatuljak: 91Niki "sushi is murder" peta
[2019-02-26 16:47:43 UTC] yungorcmane: Gaming on YouTube is a cest pool of negativity because content creators dont know how to be creative besides shitting on games
[2019-02-26 16:47:50 UTC] 3rdaccount10c: @aethn you only go there to see someone going berserker mode Kappa
[2019-02-26 16:47:50 UTC] rreico: Pretty much @91Niki
[2019-02-26 16:47:51 UTC] mrgattz: @flappyurf i also hate EA's way of conducting business. i think most people do. but i like bioware and i like mechs... and i like shooting thing. so i enjoyed my 50 hours so far in anthem. people shitting on the game probly dont like mechs or shooting things, bought the game anyway, hated it, and then felt the need to express their shit opinions onto others for their own enjoyment.
[2019-02-26 16:47:53 UTC] dragonofwolves: Angry Joe likes and dislikes whatever his community likes and dislikes. I stopped watching after he reviewed Halo 5 and complained about Forge not being in when yet people who were following Halo 5 KNEW that 343 wwas making Forge available after launch. So no Angry Joe should not be taken seriously. Hes a fucking dumbass who doesnt do research
[2019-02-26 16:47:55 UTC] flappyurf: @VrtniPatuljak yeah, agree, i just loathe this extremist views holding sway over "popular opinion" :D everything is shit or OMG HYPE... no middle ground :D
[2019-02-26 16:48:01 UTC] porkbutt1984: aadBlind
[2019-02-26 16:48:01 UTC] aethn: The only thing I dont like about Anthem is the Town drags the pace of the game down to a crawl. But the good thing is once the story is done its all about Launch Bay and killing things no more annoying love stories and such
[2019-02-26 16:48:08 UTC] phantom_wulfstan: he post miss information himself sometimes so i doubt he would not going to fit his narrative LUL
[2019-02-26 16:48:09 UTC] tokasmke: What's all the hate about this game? I think its pretty good.
[2019-02-26 16:48:09 UTC] warmaku: i agree with everything people are hating on this game for but im still playing
[2019-02-26 16:48:10 UTC] mortedeangelis: @91Niki What do you mean you think that Shushi is amazing rooREE This resturant is stupid and should be shut down and not selling this overpriced fish rooREE (am I don't it right? rooThink )
[2019-02-26 16:48:16 UTC] grittytexan: I wouldn't salvage all the weapons @Towelliee because once you decide to use a different Javelin those Javelins can use those weapons
[2019-02-26 16:48:17 UTC] flappyurf: @MrGattz fair enough.
[2019-02-26 16:48:18 UTC] mortedeangelis: doing it *

[2019-02-26 16:48:44 UTC] radas31: @warmaku I'm in the same boat lol Gameplay is fun when you can actually play :P
[2019-02-26 16:48:46 UTC] zadwanaa: i dunno... i thought angryjo was just joining the hate bandwagon.. he was right on some parts... and other parts he was milking.
[2019-02-26 16:48:48 UTC] miguel85nyc: damn
[2019-02-26 16:48:48 UTC] sharie: like that Youtuber that claimed that EA removed his Anthem Review because it wasnegative but it was a Sponsored and then when it was his Turn to prove it was not he refused LUL
[2019-02-26 16:48:48 UTC] moudi: hey @towelliee
[2019-02-26 16:48:54 UTC] chubbycheeto: Lets do a review of WoW while only ever playing the level 20 trial
[2019-02-26 16:48:55 UTC] mrgrumpleton: @Towelliee I like the YT that was reviewing the road map the other day, was complaining that he didn't know when the next Stronghold would be added to the game and there was literally a segment on the screen showing when the next stronghold comes in.
[2019-02-26 16:49:04 UTC] zadwanaa: claiming there's no loot in a lootershooter.... whites are loot... ive goten 20+ items... granted, only 1 or 2 were MW
[2019-02-26 16:49:08 UTC] greetan: @towelliee any update when the bug with the javelin in the fort will be fixed
[2019-02-26 16:49:09 UTC] thejipocalypse: @dragonofwolves he started talking about politics and that’s when I dipped and he also said he hates “Grindy” games so I can’t take his review of “grindy” games serious
[2019-02-26 16:49:09 UTC] devildriver1919: you can play whatever javelin you want and switch whenever right?

[2019-02-26 16:49:48 UTC] 91niki: I'd like for humanity to just go one whole day without enforcing the negative and focus on the positive instead. One day. Or is that too much to ask? 🤔
[2019-02-26 16:49:51 UTC] phantom_wulfstan: @dragonofwolves close to yongyea levels of dumb actually

[2019-02-26 17:46:59 UTC] evoca85: I hate that Anthem came out in its current state. I was so hyped for it and it was poorly done. I'm playing it right now because the combat is fun, praying for decent loot. But when you see a game so well done like Apex release, you wonder where Anthem devs went wrong.

[2019-02-26 17:58:06 UTC] herodpilate: @Zadwanaa it just kind of left a bad taste in my mouth because all the hard work I put into it was for not. Why would I continue to play a game that was gonna just "give" new players the same or better gear than I worked my ass for? Just my perspective mind you. kdubShrug
[2019-02-26 17:58:15 UTC] thisthc: so RNG is real concept PogChamp

[2019-02-26 17:58:31 UTC] thejipocalypse: they fixed the division a year later lol
[2019-02-26 17:58:32 UTC] sakyto76: @Towelliee Have you seen the new way to farm constantly this dungeon and specifically the last boss skipping the adds
[2019-02-26 17:58:36 UTC] crossnf: That's why i liked Destiny loot drops from Bosses were predetermined pool of items
[2019-02-26 17:58:37 UTC] pulseonline: Honestly they should revert the loot drops back to the 11 hour window, with needing to get better inscriptions

[2019-02-26 17:59:03 UTC] broomba: If Zelda 1 came out today people would complain about it and want the master sword, shield boomerang, candles, raft and 20 hearts when they start out

[2019-02-26 17:59:36 UTC] sakyto76: @Towelliee Right after boss is dead u all click exit to main menu and when u go back u can do it again
[2019-02-26 17:59:39 UTC] biacksugardaddy: Owoo got back in time for a epic boss decimation @towelliee

[2019-02-26 17:59:44 UTC] mrgrumpleton: @Towelliee what do you think about this game as a part of a larger portfolio from EA that moves away from monetizing loot boxes and moves toward making subscription store where the goal is to get as many people as possible to annual sub for more stable annual income?

[2019-02-26 18:00:18 UTC] zadwanaa: @HerodPilate I understand, i felt the same about the pvp gear.. but i stopped caring about others... especially since people crying about flying ruining the game and now look at flying... locked away for most of the xpac. I personally, play a game if i enjoy it. No ones opinions matter more than my own ( in regards to what i enjoy ). Esp with anthem... with all those reviews saying how anthem isn't worth the money... Its like, really? Ive already put in 60 hours and ive been playing for less tha

[2019-02-26 18:02:14 UTC] herodpilate: @Zadwanaa I stopped playing because of my own opinion. The game was going into the shitter. That opinion for me has not changed. WoW died about 5 or 6 years ago. But I get what you're saying. I don't care about reviews or other peoples opinions when it comes to games. A lot of games people think are terrible are pretty fun honestly to me. To each their own, as they say.
[2019-02-26 18:02:22 UTC] xmokushirokux: its an exploit, quitting the session and rejoining over and over

[2019-02-26 18:03:14 UTC] muaytitus: its not proper, its just a way to farm the boss over and over

[2019-02-26 18:03:24 UTC] biacksugardaddy: Sounds like an exploit @towelliee
[2019-02-26 18:03:27 UTC] crushn_u: clearly exploit if u have to exit game

[2019-02-26 18:03:29 UTC] herodpilate: @Broomba still laying down the facts. Most people can't appreciate games nowadays because they never had to work their asses off or figure things out to beat a game because Google and guides ruined it for kids and adults alike.

Now there are 100 dollar packs of in game currency to buy sunglasses and shoes.

[2019-02-26 18:30:58 UTC] kappamerc: Loot the final boss as soon as he dies to get double loot
[2019-02-26 18:31:00 UTC] germanbacon: do i even need the coin currency for anything else besides appearances?
[2019-02-26 18:31:10 UTC] triplestruck: i just got a devesator masterwork!
[2019-02-26 18:31:16 UTC] sackilles: so here's a borderline non stream friendly bug. if you dive bomb the corpse of the stronghold boss when it dies you'll get another mastwork at the end. haven't been able to do myself and maybe only on scar
[2019-02-26 18:31:20 UTC] kappamerc: I just hoped on
[2019-02-26 18:31:21 UTC] biacksugardaddy: @triplestruck nice

[2019-02-26 18:32:02 UTC] zadwanaa: btw @Towelliee if you kill a stronghold boss.. he drops a MW.. if you dive bomb it... you can get it again
[2019-02-26 18:32:07 UTC] sackilles: does that trick work on tyrant tho?
[2019-02-26 18:32:07 UTC] crushn_u: imagine if a leggo drops

[2019-02-26 19:02:49 UTC] zadwanaa: @Kickin_Waffles think it'll fix audio bug?
[2019-02-26 19:02:52 UTC] stanislav114: @ThisTHC I watched some stream while that loot bug was on and everyone was having tons of fun and actual gameplay was rewarding but looking people now, most people that play Anthem are not even smiling. I can't really believe how can you get loot wrong in a looter game :/
[2019-02-26 19:03:03 UTC] anicary_: I do love this game tho
[2019-02-26 19:03:24 UTC] kappamerc: Yeah, those furies typically give good loot. Great dungeon to do from the start
[2019-02-26 19:03:30 UTC] drelnar: then fly and stay above him ? 🤔
[2019-02-26 19:03:36 UTC] zadwanaa: @Anicary_ for me... its the gameplay.. and not many games, IMHO, can compete to the gameplay
[2019-02-26 19:04:01 UTC] anicary_: I really do like the way this game plays its beautiful aswell
[2019-02-26 19:04:12 UTC] thisthc: @stanislav114 yeah because loot was dropping at a higher rate intended so if they never fixed it and people got everything they wanted in 2 days how would this type of game survive. I cant really believe people still dont understand that in a game like this youre not supposed to have shit force fed to you LUL
[2019-02-26 19:04:38 UTC] thekarmazone: what gun is that
[2019-02-26 19:04:51 UTC] zadwanaa: i would like more scenery... more variety in where you fight... a massive truck loads of cosmetics... but yeah, its a gorgeous game
[2019-02-26 19:05:11 UTC] thekarmazone: @Towelliee What gun is that?
[2019-02-26 19:05:38 UTC] spectrewolf24: gun sound means team synergy
[2019-02-26 19:05:42 UTC] kappamerc: Div2 gameplay is alright but Anthem is more fun. The seamless world in DIv2 is top notch though. You just walk into an area and it's automatically a dungeon, no loading.

[2019-02-26 19:05:53 UTC] zadwanaa: @stanislav114 they didn't get loot wrong. You arent suppose to get a truck loads of MWs & Leggos... you get a truckload of loot and maybe a few peices are good.
[2019-02-26 19:05:58 UTC] darthmoots: is the game coming out this weekend or you have to pre order divison 2?
[2019-02-26 19:06:01 UTC] zadwanaa: @stanislav114 thats a looter.
[2019-02-26 19:06:08 UTC] kappamerc: open beta @darthmoots
[2019-02-26 19:06:11 UTC] mickeychr: I see your point @ThisTHC But what would you rather, get that 1 piece of loot you want with shit stats, or the same piece of loot a lot of times to try and get the best possible stats. If it's hard to get more than once, people with settle, getting it often will have people hunting for better versions and builds
[2019-02-26 19:06:13 UTC] zadwanaa: @darthmoots the open beta is comin out this weekend
[2019-02-26 19:06:17 UTC] stanislav114: @ThisTHC Well there are so many flaws in this loot system too.
[2019-02-26 19:06:21 UTC] darthmoots: thank you all
[2019-02-26 19:06:21 UTC] therealinsan3d: the div 2 looks the exact same as the div 1, might as well be a DLC
[2019-02-26 19:06:25 UTC] drelnar: ults are a waste of time against this boss, you make much more damage with weapons, you just use it to heal @Towelliee
[2019-02-26 19:06:46 UTC] thisthc: NotLikeThis
[2019-02-26 19:06:55 UTC] louisgee95: What rolls are on that gun? It's got crazy dps
[2019-02-26 19:06:56 UTC] zadwanaa: @Mickeychr its not hard getting master works... its hard getting legendaries... its a time sink. WHy are people so anti sime sinks when playing a game?
[2019-02-26 19:07:01 UTC] thisthc: the point of a game like this is to grind for the loot you want
[2019-02-26 19:07:05 UTC] thisthc: period lol
[2019-02-26 19:07:27 UTC] decoythatguy: towelliee shoulda picked up ammo and armor before going to the next phase. but thats just me
[2019-02-26 19:07:48 UTC] thisthc: I mean for GM2/GM3 yes
[2019-02-26 19:07:53 UTC] zadwanaa: They need to fix GMs... of course. there hsould never be a white in GM1, i'd even go as far to say no green or VERY rarely a green in GM 2
[2019-02-26 19:07:54 UTC] tagteam421: any new legos today?
[2019-02-26 19:07:57 UTC] drelnar: stay on the rocks/broken towers :)
[2019-02-26 19:07:58 UTC] kylemcd: this game is fire af
[2019-02-26 19:07:58 UTC] stanislav114: @Zadwanaa i'd prefer alot of shit loot with a few decent drops and a way to "break" that weak gear for materials, and here its the but way too rpg you can end up grinding for years without good loot and someone playing from 1 week can come in rng and get ultra gear/
[2019-02-26 19:08:07 UTC] kappamerc: don't die team
[2019-02-26 19:08:16 UTC] daihenka: I just got a MW explosive blaze grenade for ranger that has +40 Ice effect for a fire based grenade... wooo this affix quality
[2019-02-26 19:08:25 UTC] boozequest: Hi Towelliee, do you also think this game is trash? Wish I could get my time and money back :D
[2019-02-26 19:08:32 UTC] therealinsan3d: you need bad affixes to dilute the pool
[2019-02-26 19:08:45 UTC] alpha_omega_prime: I have to agree no fixed loot table. Random only. Make it more interesting.
[2019-02-26 19:08:47 UTC] d0cbert: what do those orbs do for you? extra dmg?
[2019-02-26 19:08:48 UTC] zadwanaa: @stanislav114 thats the RNG factor. There will always be RNG. Be it the item, the rolls.. its RNG.
[2019-02-26 19:08:48 UTC] kappamerc: No fixed tables. Just increase drop rate and keep the variability of inscriptions. Makes the hunt fun.
[2019-02-26 19:08:50 UTC] therealinsan3d: the only thing they could do is make a useless inscription not so useless
[2019-02-26 19:08:55 UTC] mickeychr: I don't say the should up the legendary drops. Getting 1 or 2 a days seems like a good thing in my mind. But Masterwork? you should be showered in that shit. That'll have people trying out new builds, farming to get 4 god roll stats on that 1 ability. Also no fixed loot. Shit should be randomized @Zadwanaa
[2019-02-26 19:09:00 UTC] stanislav114: @Towelliee If there is no loot table how am i supposed to find a thing i wanna grind for ?
[2019-02-26 19:09:00 UTC] thisthc: I think that if you have harder tiers like this game does then yes the best loot should drop more often the higher you go.
[2019-02-26 19:09:01 UTC] althamos: specific loot from only x boss results in wvery other boss never getting qued for.
[2019-02-26 19:09:12 UTC] d0cbert: ^
[2019-02-26 19:09:14 UTC] drelnar: i'd rather have a way bigger loot table but that hard of a "perfect stat grind", getting a specific piece is easy, getting it with perfect stats is just not interesting
[2019-02-26 19:09:23 UTC] therealinsan3d: i've gotten 1-2 legionaries every day, which seems good
[2019-02-26 19:09:24 UTC] triplestruck: @BoozeQuest the game is great

[2019-02-26 19:09:32 UTC] therealinsan3d: legendaries

[2019-02-26 19:09:44 UTC] linvoni: @Towelliee do you think this game should have some healing capabilities? like the storm having healing and dmg buffs or do you think there should be more dmg mitigation abilities like for the colossus?
[2019-02-26 19:09:45 UTC] xkayne: I havent touched GM yet and ive died a thousand times on some fights just on hard
[2019-02-26 19:09:54 UTC] stanislav114: @Zadwanaa I think GM1 stronghold drops 100% masterwork ?

[2019-02-26 19:10:56 UTC] pulseonline: This boss takes entirely way to long
[2019-02-26 19:10:56 UTC] stanislav114: @JaricZivadin99 What you currently see on screen is prob what your gonna be doing 90% of the game, its a looter game a.k.a repetitive
[2019-02-26 19:10:57 UTC] xkayne: @JaricZivadin99 im bored of anthem after 4 days.
[2019-02-26 19:11:05 UTC] zadwanaa: @Mickeychr i'm just curious.. have you played D3 lately? Its pretty got a solid system... at higher difficulties... and by higher, i mean the highest... the loot rains from the sky... good stuff, bad rolls but good stuff. Thats how it should be. GM1 shouldn't be rainable MWs... thats tooo easy. we carried 2 fresh 30s (Friends) through GM1 both Tyrant mine & Scar... GM 2 should have a good amount and 3 should be raining.
[2019-02-26 19:11:07 UTC] thisthc: all I know is I just hit 30 yesterday and have done like 10 gm1 stronngholds and im now on GM2 at 485 like getting loot is simple. Getting the loot you want is not which is why games like this make people BabyRage
[2019-02-26 19:11:17 UTC] triplestruck: @JaricZivadin99 division 2 wil be just as repetitive, its a loot based game
[2019-02-26 19:11:22 UTC] althamos: I've been grinding non stop dince launch, gives me the feel of borderlands again

[2019-02-26 19:11:36 UTC] linvoni: @JaricZivadin99 wait until they both get well into their stride then decide but if you have to scratch the itch just play warframe for a low risk game cause its free
[2019-02-26 19:11:37 UTC] swiftsloth7: @Towelliee what do you think about MW and Leggos having a minimum inscription bonus like 50% for elemental damage or something? The only legendary I've gotten so far came with +5% ele dmg and was gear locked :(
[2019-02-26 19:11:37 UTC] mickeychr: Wait for division to come out, look at the game through streams, reviews and youtube videos and see which one you like best before purchasing @JaricZivadin99
[2019-02-26 19:11:48 UTC] dreeeewster: @TripleStrucK But it will have pvp :D
[2019-02-26 19:11:48 UTC] kappamerc: This fight is way too long lol
[2019-02-26 19:11:54 UTC] zadwanaa: @stanislav114 i think anything in GM1 should give you atleast 1 MW 100% its a percentage they can fix... think they got some bad intel from D2 players
[2019-02-26 19:12:00 UTC] triplestruck: @ThisTHC some people wil just never understand lol
[2019-02-26 19:12:01 UTC] shrenko: your Javelin 500+ powers just look like a lvl 1 Javelin. so sad there is no customazation
[2019-02-26 19:12:07 UTC] lazybumog: most your team not using damage bubbles

[2019-02-26 19:13:59 UTC] zadwanaa: @zelgodis39 probably for the best fo rnow. You will benefit from the stuff theyre adding in. Ive played it nonstop when i get home. On weekend, ive stayed up til 4 am. its a VERY different game
[2019-02-26 19:14:01 UTC] thisthc: I mean most people that dont like the game dont like any game. Or only like games from 10 years ago although games are different these days LUL
[2019-02-26 19:14:13 UTC] n8urso: @zelgodis39 the game is amazing actually. to be honest if youre on console there are way less issues than PC for some reason. its the content that's lacking really that's all
[2019-02-26 19:14:20 UTC] zadwanaa: @Mickeychr should be both. The amount & quality should be higher.

[2019-02-26 19:14:33 UTC] triplestruck: @Dreeeewster cause of pvp in division 1 all the good builds were nerfed into the ground, unless they can seperate balance changes from pve n pvp (which they wont) the loot will always be watered down in pve cause of the pvp balance

Unlike most of those reviews.... Esp angry joes ultra biased review... Theres tons of loot in strongholds. Chests drop 6? items and boss drops 4? 2 chests per stronghold. not to mention trash drops

[2019-02-26 19:30:31 UTC] dailyfatiguebar: @Towelliee Interceptor is high risk/reward and it's easy to get turned around or lost in fight. But, it's fun as hell to play.

[2019-02-26 19:31:45 UTC] linvoni: @TripleStrucK but that's indcitive of a larger problem why are YOU letting someone's shortcut through sacrificing money affect your gameplay and enjoyment? In an opportunity cost scale then taking a day off work to grind has the same effect of less money but more in game power. Their actions are in no way related to you in the same way that someone spends all day grinding with no job, school, etc.
[2019-02-26 19:31:53 UTC] flamingo420: I wish there was more into this game like the endgame, 6 years I feel like they must've scrapped and restarted a few times.

[2019-02-26 19:36:17 UTC] triplestruck: @Pro2point0 best advice is to just watch as much gameplay as you can and decide for yourself, i dont want to tell you its worth it and then you dont enjoy it

[2019-02-26 19:38:20 UTC] tieluhsee: @Pro2point0 I've only logged about 5-8 hours so far due to work and just life in general but the gameplay so far has been amazing. I'm not one to rush through games so I don't have the same issue as others with the lacking end game, but that's just my opinion.

[2019-02-26 20:15:37 UTC] schluky: Ye my bad was answering a statement from chat, Gunslinger mod (allthough broken now) gives 60% weak spot dmg from hovering, Herald gives 200% hover bonus, and you get a shield as Storm for hovering. Then theres a few other weapons that incrase dmg/ weak spot dmg from hovering
[2019-02-26 20:15:55 UTC] mrgattz: for those wondering, https://twitchstocks.com/stock/twll this is the stocks website. its fake money. its just a game
