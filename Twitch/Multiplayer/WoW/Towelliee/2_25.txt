[2019-02-25 13:26:54 UTC] king_jack: Thats true but dont do dungeons if you dont know what to do in the dungeon.

[2019-02-25 13:30:46 UTC] loktharogargg: scale it up with 8.1
[2019-02-25 13:30:50 UTC] cheesesorcerer: @rekinngames then i would stay at DX12, but make sure for raids and such, you always have projected textures, depth effects and particle density at high settings, these are the settings you really need, you can turn everything else down, imo these options are not really neccessary for raiding and drain fps

[2019-02-25 13:32:03 UTC] bigrogue_35: @Menswear_TV ya it's been a rough 2 years. Stone will go to boston, calgary or winnipeg. im thinking winnipeg, suspicion liane comes back to sens if stone can agree to long term contract before the trade.
[2019-02-25 13:32:09 UTC] germanbacon: the arcway had alcohol

[2019-02-25 13:33:19 UTC] menswear_tv: @bigrogue_35 Laine would be a good snag for you guys. Boston just missed out on getting Nyquist from the red wings. I really wanted to get him (I went to college with him and got to watch him play, he is insane). But yeah hopefully Bruins match a good offer for Stone.

[2019-02-25 13:38:12 UTC] rekinngames: I don't 100% love how legendaries worked in Legion, but they didn't need to be totally eliminated in BFA
[2019-02-25 13:38:14 UTC] fafoo204: only bad part of legendaries was how many bad ones there was early on. If they just fixed that for BFA the system would've been fine
[2019-02-25 13:38:19 UTC] bebeoeuf: it's baby egg in french

[2019-02-25 13:38:51 UTC] king_jack: Legion was my first xpac. I liked leggos, was nice to know I had badluck protection towards something. Now I just got 6 dungeons and a full raid with no loot and no hope in sight.
[2019-02-25 13:38:55 UTC] dreadii: I miss my artifact weapon

[2019-02-25 13:39:10 UTC] fafoo204: even tho legendaries were just psuedo content. It at least gave you shit to do
[2019-02-25 13:39:10 UTC] germanbacon: its just worse than Legion.
[2019-02-25 13:39:11 UTC] loktharogargg: leggos, artifact weapons ability + passives , tier sets

[2019-02-25 13:39:22 UTC] shaddowknight: nah the venor was a good thing, but you need higher prices at the start of the expansion
[2019-02-25 13:39:26 UTC] shadowcaius: I mean do you think Azerite armor is fun?
[2019-02-25 13:39:37 UTC] uther_the_lightbringer: i was defending bfa at first
[2019-02-25 13:39:37 UTC] wewur: and item sets. AND most importantly leave master loot
[2019-02-25 13:39:45 UTC] zeitgeiz: azerite is more fun now, still hate the refarming traits
[2019-02-25 13:39:50 UTC] centigrade: I don't like game lore... but the lore of depleting the artifact weapons to save Azeroth shows that we were too OP in Legion
[2019-02-25 13:39:57 UTC] germanbacon: i will never forget how i got my first Legendary. It was the multishot belt for MM Hunters Kreygasm
[2019-02-25 13:39:58 UTC] crazyloca_pr: i got my first lego 4 months later on legion
[2019-02-25 13:40:01 UTC] xuen1983: artifact gear just sucks compared to lego's

[2019-02-25 13:40:18 UTC] jeffy_po0: @Towelliee how can you say total RNG legendary system is fine as a mythic raider? I remember in Emerald Nightmare that which legendaries a person had became a deciding factor in raid invites.
[2019-02-25 13:40:27 UTC] wewur: remove personal loot
[2019-02-25 13:40:35 UTC] wewur: game breaking system no one wanted

[2019-02-25 13:41:34 UTC] centigrade: It's a double-edged sword tho... people would have been pissed if they kept farming for nothing
[2019-02-25 13:41:35 UTC] liamberry121: I thought the neck was having its own upgrades or something?
[2019-02-25 13:41:58 UTC] zellidon: I liked the legendaries just not the way that it was basically put on an invisible progress bar type thing. They should be straight random and extremely rare imo.
[2019-02-25 13:41:58 UTC] mirtiori: And they might change it soon.... like they have done before
[2019-02-25 13:42:05 UTC] klaatuzu: the new system will always involve farming AP for the gtraits
[2019-02-25 13:42:26 UTC] rekinngames: I love AP farming...
[2019-02-25 13:42:27 UTC] thunderbrew: Then you should farm AP so you are ahead of the game
[2019-02-25 13:42:28 UTC] malefrom73: farming is so boring
[2019-02-25 13:42:32 UTC] lord_draxis: maybe AP will make traits stronger
[2019-02-25 13:42:44 UTC] sjanks: you will still need the neck lvl for the new traits on the neck?
[2019-02-25 13:42:45 UTC] klaatuzu: dude i'd like to have the chance to get a lego
[2019-02-25 13:42:52 UTC] crossnf: AP farming should have always had a weekly cap
[2019-02-25 13:42:55 UTC] king_jack: chances are the on use abilites will be the same for everyone, no class diversity
[2019-02-25 13:43:14 UTC] calphurnious: @Zellidon Straight random and extremely rare is a terrible design
[2019-02-25 13:43:20 UTC] thunderbrew: So you could stop playing WoW and play Anthem until then.
[2019-02-25 13:43:38 UTC] zellidon: Potato potato
[2019-02-25 13:43:45 UTC] lord_draxis: I can't believe they're still changing so much about bfa this deep in the xpac
[2019-02-25 13:43:47 UTC] aquadriel: theres no motivation to farm AP, 400 pieces ask for 44 on last lvl, and that last lvl is a minor boost for people who only do up to HC raids.
[2019-02-25 13:43:56 UTC] centigrade: Would be a good time for them to make the neck level account-wide

[2019-02-25 13:47:09 UTC] snewptd: @Towelliee Later with anthem tell people not to pick up their purple contracts as if 2 people are on the same quest it burns both of them in 1 run

[2019-02-25 14:07:25 UTC] deadlydag: I can't find the comment, but whoever said movie critics are bad.. I disagree. You just have to actually listen/read. They rarely (and shouldn't) say if they liked the movie, or give it a rating on if they LIKED the movie, but if the movie was well done. Good acting etc. As an example, I can't stand "Inglourious Basterds", but I still agree that it's a good movie. I just don't like it. I still recommend it to people I know like those kinds of movies.

And the amount of people not understanding that you need to press the green button to open the door to get out.. It's so insane. They literally stand there for 20sec before they go "oh, I press the green button that says OPEN?" FlipThis

[2019-02-25 14:16:02 UTC] pipchestley: with armor sets, your characters get abilities that make the game super fun. I've played a lot of div 1 and it eventually evolved to a great game

[2019-02-25 14:34:19 UTC] flyingsloppyjoe: Why would you make a WoW2? The story is just getting started.
[2019-02-25 14:34:32 UTC] bronloch: LUL Asmon trolls the ESO guys ALL the time! "Yea yea boiz we're gonna play eso in about an hour!" and then an hour later its the same thing! LUL

[2019-02-25 15:48:34 UTC] naamtar: the devs said they plan on an overarching story over the next several years, honestly the end of the game feels like a 1/3 point in a normal BioWare story

[2019-02-25 15:50:54 UTC] lugzgaming: @Crystalforge Anthem has a good amount of issues but I think too many are jumping on the "Anthem is shit" bandwagon.

[2019-02-25 16:00:20 UTC] naamtar: @Towelliee did you know autocannons are bugged and fire 2 shots for every 1 bullet that connects? Imagine how strong it'll be when they fix it.

[2019-02-25 16:00:36 UTC] berzkytv: @tutrinatrusanusbananus Before they removed the text on the difficulties i think GM3 was around 600% and GM2 might have been 500% but definitely around there lol
[2019-02-25 16:00:42 UTC] flexxy: is there any news about crossplay for future Anthem ?
[2019-02-25 16:01:17 UTC] berzkytv: not to my knowledge
[2019-02-25 16:01:19 UTC] darksider2008: i still havent made 30 yet sheesh should i do strong holds or what
[2019-02-25 16:01:25 UTC] naamtar: @flexxy last dev stream they said there's nothing technical holding them back from crossplay, they just need to work it out with Microsoft and Sony
[2019-02-25 16:01:33 UTC] lugzgaming: cross platform play will help a ton imo. If they're not going to include pvp(which personally I don't agree with) then there's no reason to not include crossplay
[2019-02-25 16:01:38 UTC] zadwanaa: @Darksider2008 think doing freeplays the best way to level up to 30

[2019-02-25 16:11:04 UTC] naamtar: @naightshade they borked the loot drop rate for 11 hours on Friday before they reverted it
[2019-02-25 16:11:04 UTC] yellaboy_12: Storm need a defense buff way to squishy
[2019-02-25 16:11:06 UTC] gandalfsan: what do you think of the interceptor class? (anyone)
[2019-02-25 16:11:19 UTC] thenews: Rangers are a ton of fun, i think they are very underrated. Their mobility and det capability make them very useful.
[2019-02-25 16:11:23 UTC] snewptd: @yellaboy_12 or fix the timing of dodge
[2019-02-25 16:11:24 UTC] naamtar: @gandalfsan I have all 4 classes to 480+ and Interceptor is my favorite :)
[2019-02-25 16:11:40 UTC] sunnz_lfc: @gandalfsan is my main, very fun but on hard can get 2 shot by even scorpians, very fun to wiz around though
[2019-02-25 16:11:42 UTC] swiftsloth7: @gandalfsan i main it, very fun, VERY hard to be effective at high end content
[2019-02-25 16:11:45 UTC] yellaboy_12: storm is my fav just way to damn squishy
[2019-02-25 16:11:48 UTC] naightshade: @Naamtar Yeah noticed, But also saw alot of posts on reddit about it being decreased even more than before, but not sure if thats true at all
[2019-02-25 16:11:51 UTC] budlesss: currently 25 interceptor
[2019-02-25 16:12:05 UTC] budlesss: hard out here for a squishy melee
[2019-02-25 16:12:09 UTC] naamtar: @naightshade think it's just placebo, can't see why they'd drop it lower than originally intended unless they accidently screwed something up
[2019-02-25 16:12:15 UTC] gandalfsan: I really enjoy interceptors mobility. I've almost always opted for damage focused classes in games similar to this but the interceptor definitely is enjoyable.
[2019-02-25 16:12:25 UTC] naightshade: Agree Naam, Thanks ;)
[2019-02-25 16:12:27 UTC] dhevoni: storm is not squishy with shield% max
[2019-02-25 16:12:30 UTC] sketchsquadttv: kick some SCAR ASS BRO @ towelliee
[2019-02-25 16:12:32 UTC] zillathor: Im a 488 interceptor i think im doing well
[2019-02-25 16:12:34 UTC] naamtar: @gandalfsan Interceptor is highest single target DPS :)
[2019-02-25 16:12:35 UTC] sketchsquadttv: GET SOME!! <3\
[2019-02-25 16:12:39 UTC] sunnz_lfc: triple jump and then dash then fly is so satisfying too

[2019-02-25 16:12:53 UTC] sketchsquadttv: LOL
[2019-02-25 16:12:57 UTC] itwasbg: @naightshade ya they tried to slightly lower the drop but the update buffed the drop rate. So they nerfed it to fix the mistake, then nerfed it again because that was the original intention
[2019-02-25 16:13:01 UTC] sketchsquadttv: Jst do it like Nike dawg
[2019-02-25 16:13:11 UTC] gandalfsan: is that so @naamtar ?? in still sitting at 50 pwr because I havent gotten to play much so I'm naive still Haha ty for the info
[2019-02-25 16:13:15 UTC] guipro312312: Wich class should i do for my first time? I dont know th√© game so far wich one should i try?

[2019-02-25 16:14:02 UTC] griffgoodman: @guipro312312 colossus and storm are easiest to play. ranger is well rounded, interceptor is super fast and twitchy (high risk high reward)
[2019-02-25 16:14:03 UTC] naamtar: @Towelliee I still see you going for crits on Hunters instead of shooting the legs out LUL
[2019-02-25 16:14:09 UTC] conman1986: Apex markers
[2019-02-25 16:14:11 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: you mean apex ?
[2019-02-25 16:14:12 UTC] nottuned: a ping would be nice
[2019-02-25 16:14:19 UTC] sipherant: anthem really needs ping markers and text chat
[2019-02-25 16:14:20 UTC] artorius_: Give me Apex ping system on any game from this day forward!
[2019-02-25 16:14:27 UTC] heatinup: i heard they are implementing a apex ping
[2019-02-25 16:14:32 UTC] guipro312312: @griffgoodman interceptor is great?
[2019-02-25 16:14:43 UTC] norcalheckler: they were talking about adding the markers like in Apex
[2019-02-25 16:14:53 UTC] ramensage: This game needs dmgmeter addon
[2019-02-25 16:15:01 UTC] sipherant: great ANOTHER COMMON
[2019-02-25 16:15:23 UTC] naamtar: @guipro312312 if you want survivability Colosus and Ranger are the best, if you want DPS Interceptor is highest single target and Storm is highest AoE/Crowd Control
[2019-02-25 16:15:25 UTC] sphynnxx: GM3?
[2019-02-25 16:15:25 UTC] griffgoodman: @guipro312312 its fast. if you focus around dodging and using good guns, they can do great damage, but they are the squishiest of the three. I would say Storm is the strongest javelin at the moment.
[2019-02-25 16:15:27 UTC] naightshade: rather see a increase in droprate tbh, The amount of useless stats on a item is pretty high so getting that perfect item will still be hard @itwasbg
[2019-02-25 16:15:55 UTC] griffgoodman: @guipro312312 *four
[2019-02-25 16:15:59 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: imagine how much fun gm2 would have been if they dident mess up the loot
[2019-02-25 16:16:01 UTC] wolfsilverheart: that would take the fun out of looter shooters
[2019-02-25 16:16:10 UTC] yellaboy_12: @GriffGoodman storm is strong but die to quickly they need an armor buff
[2019-02-25 16:16:17 UTC] guipro312312: Ill try a fire colossus i think and and storm after

[2019-02-25 16:17:02 UTC] griffgoodman: @yellaboy_12 in general? or versus special mobs like titans? i dont get hit a lot as storm, you can just blink away from projectiles :)
[2019-02-25 16:17:05 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: you should walk out of a gm2 with like 10 masterworks
[2019-02-25 16:17:16 UTC] sipherant: hell gm2 should,'t be dropping commons and uncommons at all
[2019-02-25 16:17:24 UTC] personyoumightknowsayshi: im fine with purples because i need the embers from dismantling for sigils
[2019-02-25 16:17:26 UTC] naightshade: gm2 is a challenge so it should be rewarding
[2019-02-25 16:17:29 UTC] conman1986: have they said when the loot table will be fixed?
[2019-02-25 16:17:31 UTC] sledgeza: Ya ive done a few gm2 and got a few commons and greens
[2019-02-25 16:17:33 UTC] griffgoodman: you need to prime that Luminary with acid
[2019-02-25 16:17:37 UTC] uluwatuu: I've been enjoying both storm and interceptor. 2 opposite playstyles, and yeah they are both sort of squishy, but i'll give up squishy for being fun to play. I'll adapt and lean to not be so squishy.
[2019-02-25 16:17:54 UTC] yellaboy_12: @GriffGoodman they cant really take a hit
[2019-02-25 16:17:54 UTC] thenews: i think we just need better inscription rolls. Bad inscriptions are the main reason for lack of progression.
[2019-02-25 16:17:55 UTC] biscuitness: How many hours have you logged with Anthem, @Towelliee ?
[2019-02-25 16:18:07 UTC] sphynnxx: What difficulty is this @towelliee ?
[2019-02-25 16:18:21 UTC] sunnz_lfc: if the game does not lag and bug out, dodge is easy as interceptor so you can avoid a lot of damage, if not then you get killed so easily
[2019-02-25 16:18:25 UTC] itwasbg: Gm2

[2019-02-25 16:18:52 UTC] gandalfsan: although it's early in the games life, do we have any Intel from the dev's on how far they plan to take this game?
[2019-02-25 16:18:57 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: no ammo LUL
[2019-02-25 16:19:04 UTC] gandalfsan: anything suggestive?
[2019-02-25 16:19:04 UTC] griffgoodman: @yellaboy_12 also, what difficulty? it starts feeling ok'ish with 2/3 masterwork components
[2019-02-25 16:19:13 UTC] naamtar: @gandalfsan last dev stream they said they have an overarching storyline polanned over the next several years
[2019-02-25 16:19:15 UTC] griffgoodman: @yellaboy_12 on GM1
[2019-02-25 16:19:34 UTC] ijuki: Hey @Towelliee and chat jakbHI

[2019-02-25 16:19:44 UTC] crystalforge: lol took a minute to relises no ammo
[2019-02-25 16:19:52 UTC] naamtar: @gandalfsan and EA only projected 6 million in total sales for the game at launch, so I think they'll be good
[2019-02-25 16:19:56 UTC] uluwatuu: i think it will be like destiny in a way with more stuff dropping from dlc's etc...
[2019-02-25 16:19:59 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: inb4 having to do it all over
[2019-02-25 16:20:08 UTC] alierix: all this work for a purp lol

[2019-02-25 16:20:40 UTC] im_method: is this GM2?

[2019-02-25 16:20:42 UTC] griffgoodman: @yellaboy_12 okay. dunno what to say, i can take 2/3 hits as long as they are not from scar snipers, furies, frost brutes, ash brutes and luminaries
[2019-02-25 16:20:45 UTC] mrdubhead: its an important info no one shares on reddit or on streams so far :(

[2019-02-25 16:22:52 UTC] sunnz_lfc: it would be good if enemies were more weaker, so acid should destroy these enemies a lot easier

[2019-02-25 16:23:12 UTC] mrdubhead: and just rushin the GS
[2019-02-25 16:23:39 UTC] sunnz_lfc: i think with loot drops its pointless to do gm2 or 3, from what i noticed and read
[2019-02-25 16:23:42 UTC] pwntnub: nice ya GM2 is what i been playing on. GM2 is the only one i enjoy. GM2 has felt like it is where it needs to be. I always play with randoms and it seems the spot on?
[2019-02-25 16:23:43 UTC] sphynnxx: anyone that he's running with not got poison? kind of need it for these big armoured targets... plus with fire he'll get a shit load of combos
[2019-02-25 16:23:49 UTC] naamtar: @Tunabass11 a few people have completed GM3 runs, it took us 4 hours to do Heart of Rage

[2019-02-25 16:24:08 UTC] budlesss: I usually run cryo glaive and tempest strike as interceptor
[2019-02-25 16:24:11 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: just survive 4Head
[2019-02-25 16:24:12 UTC] alienfromger: dont die SwiftRage

[2019-02-25 16:24:15 UTC] steelcity91: isnt this the hardest difficulty?
[2019-02-25 16:24:20 UTC] utv_: seeing this , feels like a cluster fuck on GM2 monkaS
[2019-02-25 16:24:21 UTC] uluwatuu: the freeze is nice for the interceptor, especially close quarters with multiple enemies, but my problem is that most of the guys im grouped with use fire so it just cancels out my freeze i feel like. so i usually run acid bombs.
[2019-02-25 16:24:31 UTC] pwntnub: GM2 is the only way to get Masterwork blueprints, why is it pointless?
[2019-02-25 16:24:37 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: GM2 would have felt so amazing if you actually where rewarded for all this
[2019-02-25 16:24:39 UTC] pwntnub: GM1 is pointless
[2019-02-25 16:24:43 UTC] mrdubhead: As Example: Build the Universal Ultimate Inscripton it will roll like +70% Shield and +80% overall Armor which is a lot so you are op on survival with like 4 Masterworks. Then build as example the Melee dmg Universal it can roll 50% overall dmg and 35% Melee dmg on it.

[2019-02-25 16:25:33 UTC] mrdubhead: so far i just see everyone rushin 490+ GS which is pointless.
[2019-02-25 16:25:36 UTC] naamtar: @Towelliee when Diablo 3 released Reaper of Souls they did a double legendary event and everyone liked it so much that they just left it in, I think Anthem needs to follow suit and be more generous with the loot
[2019-02-25 16:25:42 UTC] swiftsloth7: i tried GM2 Heart of Rage yesterday for the shits...
[2019-02-25 16:25:42 UTC] necromobius: The grind in this game sucks so hard. I‚Äôve gotten 16 of one MW and ZERO of the one I want. And GM2 takes 4x as long but same loot.
[2019-02-25 16:25:42 UTC] pwntnub: I am at 488 and still getting masterwork drops pretty much atleast 1 - 2 per mission

[2019-02-25 16:25:45 UTC] swiftsloth7: laughable

[2019-02-25 16:30:16 UTC] nasilvera: What about acid spray
[2019-02-25 16:30:17 UTC] swiftsloth7: it depends what you wanna do, I run venom bomb+detonating strike sometimes if i want to solely prime since the combo aura for interceptors is actually really strong now
[2019-02-25 16:30:22 UTC] schluky: fele litek GM2 leg contracts was harders this time around, just did a few.. took fucking forever
[2019-02-25 16:30:23 UTC] mrdubhead: @Towelliee Trust me . Build 1 or 2 Universal Components it will make Gm2+ so much easier . cause of massive stat rolls ^^
[2019-02-25 16:30:27 UTC] berzkytv: no just you.
[2019-02-25 16:30:29 UTC] budlesss: acid spray is nice for floatie boys
[2019-02-25 16:30:29 UTC] necromobius: I think my biggest beef with this game is that the parts I like I absolutely love. And then the rest is broken as hell.

[2019-02-25 16:30:38 UTC] naamtar: @Towelliee pretty sure those guys are going to infinitely respawn until you kill the tank
[2019-02-25 16:30:40 UTC] alienfromger: whats the problem? class combination?
[2019-02-25 16:30:40 UTC] berzkytv: @lone_zebra Fun
[2019-02-25 16:30:47 UTC] pwntnub: I think its class combo
[2019-02-25 16:30:52 UTC] necromobius: GM2 not worth it.

[2019-02-25 16:31:16 UTC] mrdubhead: craft a few eipcs from them

[2019-02-25 16:31:19 UTC] mickeychr: @Towelliee If you have a ranger in your group, have him use the tip of the spear component, he can use that to ress players with when he makes a combo near the downed player.
[2019-02-25 16:31:22 UTC] brada7x: beanz sucks
[2019-02-25 16:31:24 UTC] pwntnub: GM1 is jsut too easy
[2019-02-25 16:31:39 UTC] schluky: epics have less armour by default though
[2019-02-25 16:31:43 UTC] necromobius: I‚Äôm 490 PL and GM2 just takes longer. They‚Äôre just tank mobs. That isn‚Äôt fun for me.
[2019-02-25 16:31:51 UTC] mr_briteside: Anyone else try to do quickplay? every time i do i load into a broken ass mission

[2019-02-25 16:32:35 UTC] triplestruck: LUL
[2019-02-25 16:32:36 UTC] mrdubhead: thats true but they can Roll like 80% more overall armor which makes you a lot crazier @Towelliee just craft some universal like ultimate universal (rank 3 freelancers i guess was it) roll some and you will get good rolls on it
[2019-02-25 16:32:36 UTC] dyasis: he now has the highground
[2019-02-25 16:32:38 UTC] tinypeanut: he really wanted bacon i guess
[2019-02-25 16:32:40 UTC] swiftsloth7: @necromobius agreed, i wouldve liked to see actual ai mechanics implemented in gm2 like flanking or combos
[2019-02-25 16:33:00 UTC] generator1111: i will buy this game ! it looks amazing
[2019-02-25 16:33:02 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: letting team just stay dead LUL
[2019-02-25 16:33:04 UTC] pwntnub: i mean, i guess everyone should be able to rolfstomp GM2 a week in
[2019-02-25 16:33:04 UTC] schluky: ai is not so bad acctually
[2019-02-25 16:33:05 UTC] mrweedoz: how could interceptor be any viable option if you need to go melee range?
[2019-02-25 16:33:12 UTC] pwntnub: thats what people want
[2019-02-25 16:33:14 UTC] pwntnub: lol
[2019-02-25 16:33:17 UTC] budlesss: gotta be fast man
[2019-02-25 16:33:19 UTC] swiftsloth7: they're adding more difficulties in march tho so maybe they will add more mechanics then hopefully
[2019-02-25 16:33:31 UTC] necromobius: @swiftsloth7 Yeah exactly. I like the fast gameplay. Quick hover. But GM2 was just a giant stop sign on that gameplay with no benefit that I can tell. I‚Äôd like some variety too.
[2019-02-25 16:33:34 UTC] naamtar: @MrWeedoz most enemies get stun locked by melee and Interceptor has a triple dash to evade
[2019-02-25 16:33:35 UTC] sunnz_lfc: @mr yea its very difficult, melee damage does not scale good enough
[2019-02-25 16:33:35 UTC] mrdubhead: @MrWeedoz im on full melee on GM2 as Interceptor and can even tank stuff :)
[2019-02-25 16:33:37 UTC] uluwatuu: @MrWeedoz hit and run man
[2019-02-25 16:33:41 UTC] flyingsloppyjoe: They took out the % of drop rate and increased health. Now it just says an increased chance for master work or lego.
[2019-02-25 16:33:44 UTC] hard_liqour: Boss gets high ground smart ass aI
[2019-02-25 16:33:46 UTC] budlesss: you usually go in combo your abilities then out and gun

[2019-02-25 16:34:06 UTC] yellaboy_12: Have not seen any leg drops yet only epic and MW
[2019-02-25 16:34:25 UTC] necromobius: In around 40 strongholds I‚Äôve seen 1 legendary.
[2019-02-25 16:34:31 UTC] pwntnub: i got a nice legendary gun as soon as i hit lvl 30 was my first GM1 run lol
[2019-02-25 16:34:45 UTC] sunnz_lfc: i wish interceptor could swap the two guns for two small swords an do a lot more damage at the cost of range
[2019-02-25 16:34:53 UTC] miniturecandy: @Towelliee now that the game has launched can you give us some pros and cons?
[2019-02-25 16:34:57 UTC] yellaboy_12: i have prolly 20-25 MW not one leg
[2019-02-25 16:34:58 UTC] budlesss: some of the interceptor Master works give things during melee

[2019-02-25 16:51:47 UTC] syborc: @normysan the "E" Skill will get the dmg boost
[2019-02-25 16:51:52 UTC] normysan: ok
[2019-02-25 16:51:55 UTC] neodium08: unless you got +70% armor or something
[2019-02-25 16:51:56 UTC] dazeless173: @normysan that's just the keybinding for ability it corresponds to
[2019-02-25 16:51:59 UTC] hard_liqour: Thats why u craft the armor 1

[2019-02-25 16:52:38 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: i mean does it really matter if your E does 10k dmg or 14k dmg at this point ?

[2019-02-25 16:53:38 UTC] neodium08: I think the 40% to damage would be good, just not in GM2

[2019-02-25 16:54:12 UTC] big_whoop: is losing 1/6 of your HP worth +40dmg to your E?
[2019-02-25 16:54:12 UTC] mrdubhead: if you susin e alot

[2019-02-25 17:31:31 UTC] zadwanaa: @Towelliee i duno man... i dont think it'll decimate. It needs more than 1 stronghold sooner and porbably slightly smaller steps via Grandmaster ranks. Probably add 4 more ranks and have proper loot drops
[2019-02-25 17:31:31 UTC] biscuitness: It's *possible* they were using incomplete audio assets to reduce size for beta testing. unlikely - but still could be the case
[2019-02-25 17:31:35 UTC] teraphus: They have a roadmap already for Anthem. New stronghold next month, or the following one. Then teh "raid content" in may. They have events all over the places
[2019-02-25 17:31:37 UTC] zurgar_: @bhughess Yes. They're going to make it so that items roll with less irreverent inscriptions (mods, stats etc.)

[2019-02-25 17:33:33 UTC] nimz83: Anthem is a really fun game, but if Division 2 fixes some of the issues with Division 1 then I think it will be solid. Neither one of them are game changers.

[2019-02-25 17:33:44 UTC] gingertheninjer: The only true thing Division has is PvP wwhich people are bitching about, seriously.... why is PvP so important that you won't play anthem lol

[2019-02-25 17:36:29 UTC] thenews: the division was made a lot better over its lifecycle, it ended up being a content rich experience. I would not expect Ubi to nail the landing on launch though. Their games have been getting less and less impressive at launch.

[2019-02-25 17:41:12 UTC] zadwanaa: @Nimz83 exactly. a lot of peoples reviews about Anthem seemed pretty biased because its EA or they wanted Mass effect story in a borderlands game....
[2019-02-25 17:41:15 UTC] yukata_13: what difficulty is this grandmaster I ? or II?
[2019-02-25 17:41:19 UTC] meakis: @iron_will not really, any mission was a dungoen, incursions were really hard missions. Raids like they talk about now .. is new
[2019-02-25 17:41:19 UTC] radrez: @Towelliee in division 1 "dungeons" were placed in like police station, underground, shoping mall or united nations

[2019-02-25 17:41:50 UTC] lt_dan_and_his_magic_legs: @towelliee dungeons in division are a linear mission that open up from the world and they can take place in a building like the UN consulate, or a sports stadium. or they can be outdoors like through s train yard, to a construction site. or like start out at a foundry and progress to a skyscraper under construction.
[2019-02-25 17:41:56 UTC] nimz83: @Zadwanaa Yep. I am enjoying Anthem, but I'm looking forward to Division 2. I'll play WoW as my main game and play these others on the side.

[2019-02-25 17:43:17 UTC] masterlee05: dunoo why i hate this game.... uninstalled it
[2019-02-25 17:43:29 UTC] zadwanaa: @Nimz83 ive actually quit wow... but same boat. I played Destiny 2 until Anthem came out... while waiting for Division... and gunna see what i enjoy more. People can review whatever they want and how they want it. As long as they have fun. BUt as long as people expect the world... they'll be disappointed in anything. I want loot and i want a decent end game and a VERY good gameplay.
[2019-02-25 17:43:46 UTC] zadwanaa: Anthems crushed the gameplay... i think it'll be hard for anygame to beat Anthem gameplay imho
[2019-02-25 17:43:49 UTC] aysentaro: i like how their model and the gun looking at the ground while they shoot in 90 degree to the side
[2019-02-25 17:43:54 UTC] aysentaro: quality game
[2019-02-25 17:44:16 UTC] retrowalker: @Zadwanaa same, i realy want this game anthem to work out but im definitely excited to give d2 a shot
[2019-02-25 17:44:27 UTC] kingraven0: The gameplay is fun, and when it comes to looter shooters, that needs to be #1 The other quality of life stuff though...they need it in the game before the Div 2 launch. Div 2 right now is basically Division 1 - last end game patch.

[2019-02-25 17:44:59 UTC] kingraven0: They launched this game -months- before it was ready.
[2019-02-25 17:45:06 UTC] sickage: divison 2 seems really good in my opinion
[2019-02-25 17:45:06 UTC] villness: I really wish they give back the drop rate of bug from friday, mostly only getting the guaranteed MW drop from boss sucks a lot
[2019-02-25 17:45:17 UTC] zadwanaa: @KingRaven0 Yeah, thats what scares me. They need to go HARD with Dvision 2
[2019-02-25 17:45:17 UTC] elyseums: Best combat in the BUSINESS is in Anthem period
[2019-02-25 17:45:24 UTC] nimz83: @Zadwanaa Gameplay is very good. The took care getting the "meat" out, but forgot about the "potatoes"
[2019-02-25 17:45:31 UTC] biscuitness: I played Division some time after launch - I liked it for the mostly brief period I played it. Definitely more interested in Division 2 over Anthem (not big into Bioware)
[2019-02-25 17:45:32 UTC] mast3rcod3r: Yeah, they really need to make some QoL changes to this game.

[2019-02-25 17:45:53 UTC] taijiutsu: thats because bad reviews get clicks @Towelliee
[2019-02-25 17:46:00 UTC] datcreepa: it took over a year of patches for the division to improve
[2019-02-25 17:46:01 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee completely fair and more than reasonable
[2019-02-25 17:46:01 UTC] layercake: Division is a cover tactical shooter, not everyone like that style
[2019-02-25 17:46:02 UTC] mast3rcod3r: I love the game but its missed on so many simple QoL stuff.
[2019-02-25 17:46:08 UTC] germanbacon: i hate that certain "News Youtuber" already call the game dead

[2019-02-25 17:46:29 UTC] mcpot: I still manage to get 400 hours into the division 1
[2019-02-25 17:46:29 UTC] aysentaro: and what game did poorly at release and then got good after a month, i cant recall a single game that did it
[2019-02-25 17:46:30 UTC] zadwanaa: @Nimz83 now i want steak & eggs. Thanks
[2019-02-25 17:46:34 UTC] klaatuzu: its not very realist to expect Anthem to change much in a short amount of time
[2019-02-25 17:46:35 UTC] aysentaro: dont get your hopes high
[2019-02-25 17:46:35 UTC] datcreepa: and also if the streamers don't like it, it goes a long way in swaying public opinion
[2019-02-25 17:46:38 UTC] militaryrednek: im really enjoying div2, played all the betas and alpha. funa part will be leveling, then the world changes when you hit max level with new baddies in the world.
[2019-02-25 17:46:42 UTC] spaceneedle20: Played the division 2 beta and it was just division 1 in a new more colorful city.
[2019-02-25 17:46:44 UTC] nasilvera: Same with no mans sky
[2019-02-25 17:46:49 UTC] kingraven0: WoW is superrrrr polished, they have YEARS of player data to do so.
[2019-02-25 17:46:49 UTC] sonatta: Division Devs held a player summit and had to talk to their top players to find out what they needed to do to improve Division, and the Devs listened, that's why Division 1 turned around
[2019-02-25 17:46:51 UTC] poniiee: just got a legendary railgun o:
[2019-02-25 17:46:52 UTC] haxzorjimduggan: not WoD though LUL
[2019-02-25 17:46:53 UTC] thenews: Rainbow Siege and SoT are good examples of games being able to come back around from a bad launch though. The devs just need to remain passionate and keep making the game better.
[2019-02-25 17:46:56 UTC] elredge: Anthem will be a great game, after 1-2 year...The division 2 have the adventages to start on the foudation of Div 1.

[2019-02-25 17:47:26 UTC] thenews: Diablo 3 could have died at launch, Blizzard brought that game back from the brink.
[2019-02-25 17:47:28 UTC] og_kawngi: @Towelliee Travis Day who worked on WoW loot and the D3 expansion loot made a pretty nice post on the Anthem subreddit for stuff they can improve on

[2019-02-25 17:47:37 UTC] aysentaro: at least D3 was a decent game even at launch
[2019-02-25 17:47:38 UTC] nimz83: So farm that's where Anthem has failed, they haven't learned imo.
[2019-02-25 17:47:38 UTC] taijiutsu: @KlaatuZu hell yeah POE way better than D3

[2019-02-25 17:48:18 UTC] zadwanaa: @KlaatuZu D3 failed hard... but it wasnt poe that inspired them.. the new people they brought in for D3 to fix the game helped

[2019-02-25 17:48:55 UTC] aysentaro: @Taijiutsu compared to what, anthem sucks 10 times more than D3 did at the time
[2019-02-25 17:48:56 UTC] k_a_n_j_i: Dammit @towelliee why every time I come in here ur speaking logic ima have to come back later when we descend into sheeple again.
