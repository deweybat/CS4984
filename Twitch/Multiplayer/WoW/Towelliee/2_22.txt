[2019-02-22 05:54:43 UTC] vphoenix07: @andre1023 because if you go negative you get more views
[2019-02-22 05:54:50 UTC] dragonofwolves: andre1023 because its EA.. well Bioware but people keep the blame on EA
[2019-02-22 05:54:54 UTC] tehbatmanfandonut: Im not even mad at connection issues cuz im having a ton of fun lol
[2019-02-22 05:55:02 UTC] xeloxy: @andre1023 I have no idea. I have been seen everything negative about it and when I am playing I just don't see it.
[2019-02-22 05:55:02 UTC] cosmic_chief: Hey guys, is this game worth buying?
[2019-02-22 05:55:08 UTC] vphoenix07: @andre1023 I absolutely love this game. I don't like EA but this game is genuinely fun to play.

[2019-02-22 05:56:49 UTC] xeloxy: @itsjay_uk I have about 30 hours in and am still loving it. That is very rare for me to put 30 hours into a game. I have serious gaming ADD so thats saying something.
[2019-02-22 05:56:50 UTC] xciiijuicebox: this looks like titanfall
[2019-02-22 05:57:06 UTC] itsjay_uk: nice @Xeloxy
[2019-02-22 05:57:21 UTC] vphoenix07: @itsjay_uk all yo have to do is get EA premier. Its like 15 bucks and you can play the full game
[2019-02-22 05:57:28 UTC] dragonofwolves: all except Titans on Titanfall are like twice the size of javelins
[2019-02-22 05:57:38 UTC] frogurt: I just played for a very little before i head to bed for work, but man the flight feels funky at first lol, was swinging everywhere
[2019-02-22 05:57:45 UTC] biscuitness: I wonder for Apex, being F2P will eat into Anthem's launch - esp both being EA.
[2019-02-22 05:57:54 UTC] xeloxy: @Vphoenix07 Yeah that is what I am doing and I feel like it has more than paid for its self this month

[2019-02-22 05:58:26 UTC] dragonofwolves: Nah Apex wont eat into Anthem at all. Although its currently eating the shit out of Fortnite... WHICH is a good thingn
[2019-02-22 05:58:37 UTC] peljack: !uptime
[2019-02-22 05:58:54 UTC] xeloxy: @itsjay_uk I feel like its a mixture of destiny, monster hunter, and warframe

[2019-02-22 05:59:04 UTC] xeloxy: No it doesnt

[2019-02-22 05:59:11 UTC] dragonofwolves: Not really, I dont get any Destiny vibes at all. More like Warframe
[2019-02-22 05:59:24 UTC] itsjay_uk: PVP would of been so good for this game
[2019-02-22 05:59:25 UTC] andre1023: Why do you need pvp though
[2019-02-22 05:59:28 UTC] vphoenix07: @Xeloxy I have been playing it nonstop and my friends have been linking me youtube videos saying its bad. But then why am I having such a good time. It's like a modern diablo where you can spend an entire afternoon playing look up and it's 3am
[2019-02-22 05:59:52 UTC] itsjay_uk: flying around killing each other

[2019-02-22 06:00:18 UTC] xeloxy: @Vphoenix07 Exactly! I will be on reddit and read stuff and then play and almost try to have a bad time but I just dont. I decided that I am going to stay away from the media for this game and just enjoy it.
[2019-02-22 06:00:18 UTC] razatiger23: If you have played this game you would know PVP would never work

[2019-02-22 06:01:52 UTC] punk_af: PVP in an RPG is a huge waste of resources
[2019-02-22 06:01:57 UTC] dragonofwolves: I'm actually ok with this the fact that theres not any PvP. Not every shooter needs fuckiung PvP...

[2019-02-22 06:12:07 UTC] innocentevil: Bad news is so far i've gotten 3 of the same masterwork, and 1 Avenging Herald
[2019-02-22 06:12:12 UTC] lfmwowgirls: @towelliee clear webbed caves at beginning before u start on boss. makes it easier brotha
[2019-02-22 06:12:13 UTC] stephensprobro: testing?
[2019-02-22 06:12:26 UTC] emberstormx: GM3 isn't tuned so that having full masterworks means you can do it, GM3 is tuned so that people with GOOD masterworks can do it. Like if you have 5 pieces that all have 150% physical damage you're way stronger than someone who just has masterworks with no synergy
[2019-02-22 06:12:49 UTC] itsjay_uk: so do you have to play in a team?
[2019-02-22 06:13:14 UTC] dragonofwolves: Thats why i said probably GM2 you gotta have half legendary level javelins to do it
[2019-02-22 06:13:14 UTC] weaponii: Someone that’s complains the hardest levels are too hard, clearly hasn’t played enough to know what they’re doing.
[2019-02-22 06:13:31 UTC] itsjay_uk: can you play this game in solo mode?
[2019-02-22 06:13:33 UTC] aplayfulcrab: what difficulty is this LUL
[2019-02-22 06:13:35 UTC] brutalgarden_: is anthem F2P?
[2019-02-22 06:13:39 UTC] dragonofwolves: kinda like heroic or mythic in WoW
[2019-02-22 06:13:40 UTC] emberstormx: like why do people want the hardest part of a game to be completable within the first week?
[2019-02-22 06:13:46 UTC] emberstormx: those same people would complain the game has no content
[2019-02-22 06:13:55 UTC] xeloxy: @itsjay_uk Yes you can but it is geared towards co op.

[2019-02-22 06:14:06 UTC] hakunamateo: adding hp to a tiny amount of content isnt "the hardest part of the game"
[2019-02-22 06:14:07 UTC] xeloxy: @itsjay_uk you actually get bonuses for playing in groups
[2019-02-22 06:14:09 UTC] danksly: if theres one thing i know about damage its dont underestimate a multiplier

[2019-02-22 06:14:41 UTC] rekira: Is the 4 hours/10m how much time he's been streaming or how much time left?
[2019-02-22 06:14:47 UTC] emberstormx: it's how looter shooters work, idk what you think the game is, but it's a looter shooter, like warframe and borderlands, the idea is to get better gear to do harder versions of the same content

[2019-02-22 06:34:42 UTC] upshift_: @razatiger23 ff14 only has about 500k active players with an average of about 8k per day. Only reason they still make updates is because it's a subscription based game. Once player base falls off Anthem they will give up or make an expansion you have to buy again for $60.
[2019-02-22 06:34:48 UTC] tutrinatrusanusbananus: it would be funny watching shroud play this game, just literally only criticalhits

[2019-02-22 07:16:46 UTC] dragonofwolves: Well your comparing streaming to watching videos on youtube which shouldnt even be a thinng.
[2019-02-22 07:16:50 UTC] major_warzone: why would you want pvp in this game?
[2019-02-22 07:16:57 UTC] sketchsquadttv: they need to configure
[2019-02-22 07:16:59 UTC] mize15: Did they fix the luck stat bug?

[2019-02-22 07:17:12 UTC] mynastion: @major_warzone why not?
[2019-02-22 07:17:26 UTC] biscuitness: I think it has to do with Nvidia settings.

[2019-02-22 07:18:05 UTC] sketchsquadttv: i7 is the shit
[2019-02-22 07:18:08 UTC] dragonofwolves: If Anthem is the ONLY shooter that didn't have PvP. Trust me I'd be completely fine with that
[2019-02-22 07:18:11 UTC] lazybumog: is there any fps limiter, i havent found one. some load screens that thing jumps up to 2k fps
[2019-02-22 07:18:22 UTC] infernofate: @towelliee do you feel the game deserves all the hate it’s been getting on YouTube and reviews?
[2019-02-22 07:18:28 UTC] xbabacua: the fact that bioware is actively listening and taking feedback, communicating instead of hiding shit like blizzard has says something huge about bioware
[2019-02-22 07:18:31 UTC] melteoc: but then again @Towelliee its a me problem not the game
[2019-02-22 07:18:34 UTC] dragonofwolves: absolutely not
[2019-02-22 07:18:35 UTC] savith: My only gripe with Anthem is the constant back and forth after each mission

[2019-02-22 07:41:00 UTC] catlinv: @Towelliee I came here to kick gum and chew ass. And I'm all out of ass.
[2019-02-22 07:41:11 UTC] major_warzone: will have to look at those games
[2019-02-22 07:41:11 UTC] mgtwo7: What do you think of IGN's rating of 6.5?
[2019-02-22 07:41:21 UTC] major_warzone: IGN can kick rocks
[2019-02-22 07:41:23 UTC] sketchsquadttv: i liked the rockets in the stadium @Felliuss
[2019-02-22 07:41:29 UTC] sketchsquadttv: that was fun
[2019-02-22 07:41:38 UTC] dragonofwolves: I haven't trusted an IGN review since like 2014
[2019-02-22 07:41:38 UTC] sketchsquadttv: otherwise perfect dark home slice
[2019-02-22 07:41:39 UTC] eagles4997: I wish I had this I need to get it when I get the money
[2019-02-22 07:41:46 UTC] harvtv: i havent looked at ign in years /shrug
[2019-02-22 07:41:55 UTC] major_warzone: watching IGN play videos is such a bad experience
[2019-02-22 07:42:00 UTC] sketchsquadttv: blast dem fools BRUH
[2019-02-22 07:42:01 UTC] badkarma86: @mgtwo7 ign knows nothing at the very least it's a fun game to check out worth more than6.5 imo
[2019-02-22 07:42:09 UTC] felliuss: @mgtwo7 if you check metacritic it doesnt have a single positive review soo ign was quite fair id say
[2019-02-22 07:42:13 UTC] jericco8: @mgtwo7 61/100 on metacritic ^^
[2019-02-22 07:42:26 UTC] rymere1983: didnt ign say div2 only has 20hrs of gameplay?
[2019-02-22 07:42:30 UTC] heridith: Is this GM1 or higher?
[2019-02-22 07:42:36 UTC] major_warzone: metacritic has people giving it low rating just to hate on it cause of EA
[2019-02-22 07:42:38 UTC] mgtwo7: @Jericco8 So pretty close to a 6.5? lol
[2019-02-22 07:42:47 UTC] harvtv: think for yourself, question authority
[2019-02-22 07:42:47 UTC] lennarxus: I h
[2019-02-22 07:42:47 UTC] eagles4997: how do you have such good stuff already?
[2019-02-22 07:42:58 UTC] dragonofwolves: But then again I dont trust metacritic either
[2019-02-22 07:43:12 UTC] lennarxus: I dont like ea as much as the next guy, but 6.5 seems kinda low
[2019-02-22 07:43:19 UTC] romeo9710: I think this is one thing I think they could have gotten rid of. I hate finding those damn echos
[2019-02-22 07:43:26 UTC] major_warzone: i don't think i've seen a review of someone having gotten to atleast GM1 before bashing the game
[2019-02-22 07:43:28 UTC] lennarxus: even out of spite of a company
[2019-02-22 07:43:31 UTC] mgtwo7: I'm just curious. I'm still gonna purchase and try it. Every time someone tells me something sucks, whether its a game, TV show, movie, or otherwise I end up loving it.
[2019-02-22 07:43:49 UTC] lennarxus: ^
[2019-02-22 07:43:55 UTC] jamierofficialmusic: Anthem is solid, just needs some more work and content ^^
[2019-02-22 07:44:00 UTC] badkarma86: for sure mgtwo gotta form your own opinion
[2019-02-22 07:44:00 UTC] harvtv: @Major_Warzone i know right LUL
[2019-02-22 07:44:11 UTC] jamierofficialmusic: They got the core loop working pretty well
[2019-02-22 07:44:25 UTC] mgtwo7: Absolutely, @BadKarma86. Just curious of opinions.
[2019-02-22 07:44:31 UTC] felliuss: for people who cant decide to purchase it or not, go ahead and get your free/5$ 10h trial
[2019-02-22 07:44:31 UTC] thefatapache: so, is this game decently fun? trying to find something to sink some downtime into.
[2019-02-22 07:44:49 UTC] sasinyamada: when do leggos start dropping
[2019-02-22 07:44:51 UTC] sasinyamada: at what level
[2019-02-22 07:44:56 UTC] poling622: @lennarxus they rated Division 1 6.7/10 I mean it’s just a number
[2019-02-22 07:45:01 UTC] jamierofficialmusic: @TheFatApache Best if you get a group of friends tbh. Not sure how good it'll be solo
[2019-02-22 07:45:05 UTC] cdubtheripper: monkaS
[2019-02-22 07:45:06 UTC] major_warzone: its fun and cause of materworks entire builds change around
[2019-02-22 07:45:09 UTC] lennarxus: whomp whomp
[2019-02-22 07:45:13 UTC] bwoonmappo: is there a huge difference between demo and release?
[2019-02-22 07:45:18 UTC] dragonofwolves: Come on Towelliee GM3 can't be THAT BAD
[2019-02-22 07:45:22 UTC] biscuitness: Wait - how long for GM3 content?
[2019-02-22 07:45:22 UTC] harvtv: @TheFatApache the combat is addicting when you get into the combos ( primers and detonators)
[2019-02-22 07:45:26 UTC] jamierofficialmusic: @TheFatApache It's kinda like Destiny or Division. You can do it solo, but it's a lot less fun without a squad
[2019-02-22 07:45:30 UTC] mgtwo7: Fair point @poling622 I loved The Division lol
[2019-02-22 07:45:33 UTC] mgtwo7: I can't wait for 2
[2019-02-22 07:45:38 UTC] heridith: Is GM3 even possible atm without good mods on gear?
[2019-02-22 07:45:53 UTC] thefatapache: Well damn, I would mostly be solo.
[2019-02-22 07:45:58 UTC] catlinv: @Towelliee Get a macro for it
[2019-02-22 07:46:00 UTC] poling622: People are gonna enjoy games others hate. It’s the way of life
[2019-02-22 07:46:11 UTC] biscuitness: OMG THEIR BANTER FUCK
[2019-02-22 07:46:12 UTC] felliuss: chat, what's the point of doing gm3 over gm1?
[2019-02-22 07:46:13 UTC] lennarxus: I'm pretty sold on the game at the moment, even without friends for it. just gotta wait until after this weekend
[2019-02-22 07:46:16 UTC] poling622: As long as you enjoy it that should be all that matters
[2019-02-22 07:46:23 UTC] major_warzone: are catazlysm raid or just considered THE endgame for squads?
[2019-02-22 07:46:23 UTC] how3lldaddy: i think they do gm2 not sure if gm3 is worth it for them yet

[2019-02-22 07:46:33 UTC] badkarma86: yea i think datmodz is doing gm 3
[2019-02-22 07:46:34 UTC] souless_soldier: Is ranger good?
[2019-02-22 07:46:52 UTC] major_warzone: ranger is good yes
[2019-02-22 07:47:00 UTC] prey0491: I'm doing GM2 freeplay no issue right now, 3 would be possibly with a lot of coordination
[2019-02-22 07:47:10 UTC] badkarma86: @souless_soldier i've been playing ranger, having fun so far
[2019-02-22 07:47:15 UTC] major_warzone: i'm still in hard cause i'm only 340
[2019-02-22 07:47:16 UTC] souless_soldier: @Prey0491 What javelin are u?
[2019-02-22 07:47:19 UTC] jamierofficialmusic: as your gear scales those difficulties gets easier though
[2019-02-22 07:47:22 UTC] heridith: Tyrant mine definitely seems to be the easiest farm at the moment for strongholds
[2019-02-22 07:47:24 UTC] prey0491: @souless_soldier Ranger
[2019-02-22 07:47:24 UTC] souless_soldier: @BadKarma86 The dmg isnt bad on it?

[2019-02-22 07:47:48 UTC] sketchsquadttv: just tweeted you out brotha
[2019-02-22 07:47:49 UTC] dark_revan84: I get the feeling that Titans are gonna get a nerf because just wow they are insane
[2019-02-22 07:47:55 UTC] badkarma86: @souless_soldier you just have to have the right mods and weps and you'll be fine
[2019-02-22 07:47:59 UTC] xbabacua: they need to increase the ilvl on items

[2019-02-22 07:48:09 UTC] bwoonmappo: any warframe player here playing this?
[2019-02-22 07:48:11 UTC] felliuss: since all the DLCs are gonna be free, the longer you let the game cook the better imo, so this is one of the few online games I'd suggest not to jump into on day 1
[2019-02-22 07:48:13 UTC] tsumetaishimizu: @Major_Warzone god i hope so melee feels so important on intercepter but god does it deal like no damage
[2019-02-22 07:48:15 UTC] souless_soldier: @BadKarma86 Ok thank you
[2019-02-22 07:48:18 UTC] major_warzone: triple threat titans was soo dumb
[2019-02-22 07:48:25 UTC] monsterspider: do you guys know if the stats +shield % work on all classes? like my blue bar or is it ONLY colossus shield stats
[2019-02-22 07:48:28 UTC] biscuitness: Where are all those randos who keep talking to you?
[2019-02-22 07:48:30 UTC] xbabacua: Gm1 and 2 are the most efficient for farming atm
[2019-02-22 07:48:38 UTC] melteoc: i am @bwoonmappo , and yeah it scratches that itch
[2019-02-22 07:48:41 UTC] major_warzone: i think one of the next patchs will come with inceptor buffs
[2019-02-22 07:49:01 UTC] bwoonmappo: @Melteoc can you compare these two and tell me ur idea?
[2019-02-22 07:49:29 UTC] scratchstar: they need to shorten that part imo

[2019-02-22 07:50:39 UTC] melteoc: @bwoonmappo yes but a lower scale cause Warframe has more time out, like more frames more story, so I'm saying Warframe is a box of appels, this game is one or two apples of the same taste
[2019-02-22 07:50:46 UTC] big_whoop: need the space jam song soundboard. "come on and slam"
[2019-02-22 07:51:00 UTC] lennarxus: every time towelliee ults I hear Duke nukem.

[2019-02-22 07:51:23 UTC] melteoc: but with time @bwoonmappo , more javelins more story, it will be easier to compare the 2
[2019-02-22 07:51:31 UTC] sockzyourrockz: Let that Gat bust
[2019-02-22 07:51:32 UTC] theelusivefox35: It kind of reminds me of how Warframe plays, just with brighter graphics and smoother controls, though I don't how well the controls are, never tried it yet.
[2019-02-22 07:51:34 UTC] lennarxus: space jam soundboard fix all problems
[2019-02-22 07:51:39 UTC] cdubtheripper: serious dam danP
[2019-02-22 07:51:45 UTC] badkarma86: towelliee are you playing w/ controller or keyboard?

[2019-02-22 07:52:01 UTC] major_warzone: warframe is less teamwork then this tho
[2019-02-22 07:52:22 UTC] bwoonmappo: @Melteoc ofc ofc thats what i was thinking but yeah you know you cant trust EA , bioware
[2019-02-22 07:52:37 UTC] monsterspider: is the +shield % stats work with colossus shield or all other classes blue bar "shield"
[2019-02-22 07:52:38 UTC] theelusivefox35: Not entirely true I met some really cool teams and friends on Warframe.
[2019-02-22 07:52:44 UTC] realinsanoid: Congrats on the anniversary! towHAMUP
[2019-02-22 07:53:08 UTC] big_whoop: i was playing on keyboard and mouse and my back started to hurt, tried out controller and it felt so nice to lean back and play

[2019-02-22 07:53:50 UTC] badkarma86: i gotta vote for controller just for the flying
[2019-02-22 07:54:00 UTC] bwoonmappo: tbh warframe = no endgame content hack and slash when you get to a point in the game
[2019-02-22 07:54:08 UTC] sketchsquadttv: h8ahaha KILL

[2019-02-22 08:33:03 UTC] theelusivefox35: I'll most likely wait it out two months just to see where the game goes first. As a lot of games seem to go about the same of the game comes looking, feeling, and being overall good, but then after the news reports come out and the records are at their highest they begin jamming in MTs and P2W elements in =to the game. Just want to wait and see that Anthem really sticks to their words and don't go all out on the MTs
[2019-02-22 08:33:12 UTC] grimwolf: That weapon damage... wtf?
[2019-02-22 08:33:13 UTC] kotobearz: The gear icon is the item or ability its self only.

[2019-02-22 10:51:11 UTC] onimarku: @Towelliee so in PE they made rare items, which are basically the same as epic in this game, they can drop with crazy stats that are just as good as legeendary stats but they are rare of course, they need to make it so that epics can be custom crafted with a chance to make them just as good or better then legends
[2019-02-22 10:51:12 UTC] pumpthe3rd: @towelliee you ever gonna use the other javelins?
[2019-02-22 10:51:12 UTC] bergzerkerberg: @Towelliee The contracts never ends after story mission. So you have endless contracts at end game.

[2019-02-22 10:52:53 UTC] bergzerkerberg: The contracts never ends after story mission. So you have endless contracts at end game. Epic quests is just a harder setting. Instead of mayb 1 end boss you get 2.

[2019-02-22 11:23:34 UTC] mrgattz: assuming you actualy want to play the game and engage in the story its like 25 hours.
[2019-02-22 11:23:57 UTC] rynerlutexd: Yvenia is great
[2019-02-22 11:24:15 UTC] gluesticky: That 1 quest (you know the one I am talking about) took me quite a few hours todo.
[2019-02-22 11:24:36 UTC] onimarku: @Towelliee what kinda specs would you need to stream this game from 1 pc at 1080 100fps?
[2019-02-22 11:24:48 UTC] ryykoo: Hey Towelliee. I was watching you play Anthem yesterday and fell asleep. In my dream I was playing anthem and fell asleep. The same thing happened in my dream's dream. It was the worst nightmare ever and I woke up in a cold sweat. Please don't play anthem anymore I don't want to go through that again
[2019-02-22 11:25:31 UTC] sketchsquadttv: hahah sup ryykoo
[2019-02-22 11:25:35 UTC] gluesticky: I think you need hardware encoding if you want to stream with 1 PC @OniMarku , Also I got a 9700k 2080 and can't get 100 fps on high
[2019-02-22 11:26:05 UTC] onimarku: @Gluesticky while streaming?
[2019-02-22 11:26:14 UTC] ravenward: @RyyKoo Don't worry you are still dreaming...
[2019-02-22 11:26:23 UTC] mangomechanic: Anyone here lv 30 and wants to do stronhold chest farming?
[2019-02-22 11:26:27 UTC] sketchsquadttv: haha @Ravenward
[2019-02-22 11:26:28 UTC] gluesticky: no I can't get 100 fps on high while not streaming, so imagine streaming @OniMarku
[2019-02-22 11:26:40 UTC] roman006: @ryykoo wake up!
[2019-02-22 11:27:02 UTC] onimarku: @Gluesticky strange, this game seems poorly optimized i guess
[2019-02-22 11:27:03 UTC] moobot: towHAMUP Thinking of buying a new PC? Origin builds top quality computers that always come with 24/7 customer support from a real person! If you are considering buying an Origin PC, you can check them out HERE: http://www.originpc.com/?aid=1128 towHAMUP

[2019-02-22 11:28:35 UTC] onimarku: @Gluesticky so for this game, you would need 2 pcs to stream efficiently.
[2019-02-22 11:28:42 UTC] jumpshothd: That was the easy part
[2019-02-22 11:29:02 UTC] pipchestley: water level monkaS

[2019-02-22 11:33:13 UTC] weezmc: you get it in freeroam when the instance becomes unstsable and needs to be restarted
[2019-02-22 11:33:24 UTC] sketchsquadttv: hahaha this is why i like this man
[2019-02-22 11:33:28 UTC] invaderdrumguy: @SketchSquadTTV Hey hows it going?

[2019-02-22 11:33:45 UTC] coltz_v2: it's all in what you want to play in the end
[2019-02-22 11:33:46 UTC] acenn: @IAMKnickknack you get that message if your in free roam on your own
[2019-02-22 11:33:57 UTC] gluesticky: Let's face it, these "modern mmo" aren't really mmos :-\
[2019-02-22 11:33:58 UTC] acenn: @IAMKnickknack that way your not hogging a server for your self
[2019-02-22 11:34:00 UTC] wildhardt: I mean I'm a fan of WoW but I hear FF14 is really kicking it up in terms of subscription rates atm vs WoW
[2019-02-22 11:34:01 UTC] sketchsquadttv: im here too man
[2019-02-22 11:34:08 UTC] jumpshothd: That message is for the local server they are on. The servers restart and kick everyone every 6 hours in Freeplay

[2019-02-22 11:34:52 UTC] iamthegatherer: I think loosing millions of players after the new xpac release is pretty much a problem for wow and they are not doin anything about that. I believe pay to play is a huge problem for the game
[2019-02-22 11:35:06 UTC] pushba8: The server shutdown thing in Freeplay is 2 hour long and is probably there to prevent ppl from sitting in the same freeplay for too long.
[2019-02-22 11:35:13 UTC] coltz_v2: is this GM2 @Towelliee ?
[2019-02-22 11:35:38 UTC] invaderdrumguy: @SketchSquadTTV I used to. I retired from that years ago.

[2019-02-22 12:03:31 UTC] datguyslam: for GM2 you need a group that synergizes with each other really well builds etc @Towelliee
[2019-02-22 12:03:59 UTC] theunagiroll: @poyzoneee it also has three different resistances for coils. she uses the .4 but it depends on your taste. the initial kit has a few to try :)

[2019-02-22 12:35:03 UTC] dethmold187: @DesperGaming You can get this game for $15, no need to pay $60
[2019-02-22 12:35:10 UTC] joltjoke33: Anthem is fun, story is meh. Which is unfortunate, but game is still fun
[2019-02-22 12:35:14 UTC] trawkey: Another 24 stream?
[2019-02-22 12:35:19 UTC] tewlip: Ah easy mode. No wonder that flamethrower is wrecking face
[2019-02-22 12:35:30 UTC] swadel: Strongholds are the hardest for sure
[2019-02-22 12:35:40 UTC] gluesticky: Heart of Rage isn't worth doing :-( hate titan boss and that last boss that takes 30 minutes to kill...
[2019-02-22 12:35:42 UTC] cloroxmargarita: heart of rage is the hardest and the most fun challenge but not good for farming

[2019-02-22 12:35:56 UTC] charlion2: get some luck gear and go free roaming gm 2 that means serious loot
[2019-02-22 12:36:49 UTC] srule: Does this game have lots of boss runs? Or are most contracts killing mobs?

[2019-02-22 12:37:51 UTC] dethmold187: Melee isn't doing well in the game at the moment. Too many mobs and bosses have insta kill in melee range damage
[2019-02-22 12:37:55 UTC] breyugar: Most of the Contracts have a boss or boss-style enemy at the end
[2019-02-22 12:37:58 UTC] cloroxmargarita: @Srule 3 mini bosses and 3 main bosses in the whole game, they just give them different HP and names
[2019-02-22 12:38:01 UTC] sgtmagikarp: @Srule from my experience so far, most legendary contracts have a pretty strong enemy at the end that takes some time to take down and can easily wipe ypi
[2019-02-22 12:38:45 UTC] srule: Ok, cool. I really liked the boss mission in the Demo, if they have a bunch of contracts like that, I'll buy this
[2019-02-22 12:38:51 UTC] bullrunner001: people already bashing this game?
[2019-02-22 12:39:16 UTC] dethmold187: @BullRunner001 Don't watch the Skill Up video, it's highly critical and accurate

[2019-02-22 12:39:36 UTC] sgtmagikarp: @Srule if you are on the fence about getting it, i would really advise to try the origin premium access and try it for a month
[2019-02-22 12:39:41 UTC] sneekyrhino: sorry you may have answered this but does that other weapon add elemental dmg to your gun or all your skills?

[2019-02-22 12:40:02 UTC] cloroxmargarita: @Srule if you played the demo you played half the game

[2019-02-22 12:40:14 UTC] joltjoke33: It ain’t perfect, plenty of stuff to criticize like how danSleep the story was but there’s potential for this to be a great game imo danWOW
[2019-02-22 12:40:17 UTC] iamknickknack: @Dethmold187 thats not accurate, ive seen plenty of late game interceptors with full melle builds do just fine
[2019-02-22 12:40:18 UTC] dethmold187: @joruss07 You can buy the reduced loading screen pack from the cash shop. It's $30

[2019-02-22 12:40:46 UTC] duartejonathan: is it the loot drops that got u to play anthem??
[2019-02-22 12:40:49 UTC] sgtmagikarp: @sneekyrhino when the inscription has a gear icon next to it, that means it only affects the weapon. When it has a javelin icon, thats affects everything. So the endless siege he crafted doesn't affect anything else with the 175% elemental damage
[2019-02-22 12:40:50 UTC] doodlezoink: I'm 60 hours into this game and I still haven't seen a legendary :(
[2019-02-22 12:40:52 UTC] lebignose: ah cheers
[2019-02-22 12:41:24 UTC] ewreck86: @Trio_GG lvl 8, 16 and 23 I beleve it is.
[2019-02-22 12:41:39 UTC] grobaldin: same for me @doodlezoink
[2019-02-22 12:41:48 UTC] dethmold187: @IAMKnickknack Well the Skill Up video highlighted the issue with melee quite nicely and some of the streams i've been watching who are melee have been struggling with one shots due to close proximity to bosses etc
[2019-02-22 12:41:58 UTC] sgtmagikarp: @doodlezoink i had some luck and pretty much got a legendary skill right after hitting 30 with +250% damage for it

[2019-02-22 12:42:27 UTC] stash024: I think that autocannon with the 175 ele dmg might actually work. The gear could be a visual glitch because it's pointless for it to roll that way if it's not a visual thing

[2019-02-22 12:43:47 UTC] sgtmagikarp: @Stash024 he could try it, but my own experience gettin something with +200% blast damage while it itself dealt no blast damage, showed that the gear icon unfortunatly was correct :(
[2019-02-22 12:43:53 UTC] seksaymonkey: it's funny because bruce willis is actually have german ancestry
[2019-02-22 12:43:53 UTC] grobaldin: yeah but that´s rng, but the game is hell lot of fun, i love it

[2019-02-22 13:09:58 UTC] thephenomman: @3dRes yeah and they made change that doesnt allow anyone to quickplay strongholds so its pretty much over if one leaves

[2019-02-22 14:06:56 UTC] formation225: Do we know if there is a cap on luck bonus %, i.e. is more than 100% a waste?
[2019-02-22 14:07:06 UTC] brokenones_gaming: Have u tried grandmaster 3?

[2019-02-22 14:07:38 UTC] cryttan: @Towelliee I was super hyped for the game but decided last night to actually wait it out a while. Untill I see some more end game content. Decided to actually finish the withcer 3 instead and buy the dlc for that.
[2019-02-22 14:08:17 UTC] goofy82: no consumables?
[2019-02-22 14:08:25 UTC] thunderbrew: What would you say the difference is between Destiny 2 and Anthem?

[2019-02-22 14:09:16 UTC] mrnasstyytime: @Towelliee i agree with the comment about more end game. Destiny is the perfect example. The honeymoon was great but the marriage sucked ass
[2019-02-22 14:09:33 UTC] lsbreed: @towelliee waiting on tax return :( then buying the 2070 and getting anthem for free with it.
[2019-02-22 14:09:36 UTC] blinkheals: Im still undecided this or division 2 i dont want to play both. @Towelliee
[2019-02-22 14:09:37 UTC] theyoungwolf06: any tips
[2019-02-22 14:10:03 UTC] theunagiroll: so endgame is the same as diablo or PoE where you're grinding for the perfect loadout. however PoE has maps, and Diablo has rifts/grifts. This has... a handful of mission replays

[2019-02-22 14:10:10 UTC] cryttan: @Towelliee I just don't want to buy the game, play for 30 hours then get tired of it. Cause the chance is I won't return to it even if they add more stuff. Destiny 2's bad launch just made me never want to touch the game again. Even tho it's a hundred times better by now. Same thing happened with The Division.
[2019-02-22 14:10:36 UTC] theunagiroll: @Cryttan console or PC? PC you can spend $15 on origin access to try it fora month

[2019-02-22 14:13:06 UTC] xbabacua: @towelliee did you know u can stack 2 of the same sigils? just has to be 2 different rarities.
[2019-02-22 14:13:20 UTC] zarfleen0: do you get loot only for the javelin you're currently playing or can you get stuff for your other javelins also?
[2019-02-22 14:13:37 UTC] mrgattz: @AngierGaming its the same loot tables but its more frequent masterwork items
[2019-02-22 14:13:42 UTC] clt7676: game worth playing?

[2019-02-22 14:13:52 UTC] lootfevertv: only current javelin and universal parts

[2019-02-22 14:15:29 UTC] lootfevertv: weapons count as universal
[2019-02-22 14:15:34 UTC] angiergaming: @MrGattz it is more efficient to roll the dice more often, thus GM1 is a better investment of time.
[2019-02-22 14:15:37 UTC] xbabacua: GM 2
[2019-02-22 14:15:50 UTC] mikri: so many explosions and shit happening my god lol
[2019-02-22 14:16:06 UTC] blinkheals: Is the only difference between gm is difficulty and drops? or do they have differnt events? @Towelliee
[2019-02-22 14:16:21 UTC] neounited7: have we heard when/if GM2 and 3 will start dropping higher than power level gear?
[2019-02-22 14:16:39 UTC] neounited7: GM1*
[2019-02-22 14:16:42 UTC] xbabacua: @jockelino wait till u get a god roll. mine was hitting for 85k on boss it's so dope
[2019-02-22 14:16:42 UTC] thephenomman: GM1/2/3 have expanding loot pools
[2019-02-22 14:16:45 UTC] lootfevertv: but as a storm u wont get a ranger component for example grenade cd reduction
[2019-02-22 14:16:54 UTC] dingpong22: u actually wana leave the turrets up for more of a challenge Kappa
[2019-02-22 14:16:58 UTC] thephenomman: GM1 for example has only 6 MW weapons that can drop
[2019-02-22 14:17:09 UTC] thephenomman: I mean hard
[2019-02-22 14:17:10 UTC] neounited7: i thought hard only had 6
[2019-02-22 14:17:12 UTC] neounited7: ok
[2019-02-22 14:17:18 UTC] thephenomman: GM1 has more than 6 MWs
[2019-02-22 14:17:42 UTC] blinkheals: so harder difficutly = bigger loot table?
[2019-02-22 14:17:47 UTC] thephenomman: yup

[2019-02-22 14:17:53 UTC] neounited7: but GM2/3 won't drop power lvl 50 gear, just higher chance of drops in general
[2019-02-22 14:17:57 UTC] jockelino: @xbabacua yea i have 1 decent rolled piston and 1 relly bad just ammo on it.. :D but i do like 12-17k normally but on boss after a while i do really high numbers... Gm1
[2019-02-22 14:18:01 UTC] dingpong22: CROSS THE STREAMS
[2019-02-22 14:18:03 UTC] haxzorjimduggan: dont cross the streams
[2019-02-22 14:18:04 UTC] xbabacua: @lootfevertv I beg to differ sir I get other java components all the time on my storm
[2019-02-22 14:18:04 UTC] sirscientist: Yeah, doing gm1 instead of normal means you can get masterwork gear as well not just a few guns
[2019-02-22 14:18:14 UTC] wseveryn: @Towelliee God damn go to bed watching you, wake up and your still on. About to install my SSD drive for this game. Keep on rocking man, will turn you on my tablet.

[2019-02-22 14:19:01 UTC] breyugar: @schnegsei If I remember correctly you have to kill some enemies (5 or so) in quick succession only using your Gun
[2019-02-22 14:19:16 UTC] blinkheals: The only thing i have seen that bothers me about this game is i wish it was firstperson
[2019-02-22 14:19:22 UTC] phuzzygoats: Get mini gun looks hella fun
[2019-02-22 14:19:34 UTC] silentkills22: love this game but wish it didnt follow the same pattern most games these days and think difficulty means enemies are more spongy. Higher level should mean more mechanics not health
[2019-02-22 14:19:35 UTC] phuzzygoats: That*
[2019-02-22 14:19:36 UTC] jockelino: looking to get MW black ice wanna play around with that..

[2019-02-22 14:20:46 UTC] breyugar: @schnegsei I think playing as Interceptor or Colossus (with Auto Canon) on Freeplay helps a lot
[2019-02-22 14:21:07 UTC] capncruncherz: how is the story in anthem?
[2019-02-22 14:21:22 UTC] swiftar: The story is about 7/10, but this new IP has a lot of potential

[2019-02-22 15:24:56 UTC] parks3389: @Pheelme88 day 1 fixed a lot of bugs / issues but the reviews arent about the bugs / issues but more about the core gameplay and how it feels like a basic Destiny game rather than something new and exciting
[2019-02-22 15:25:03 UTC] decoythatguy: rofl. there was a spitter in front of towelliee and it was wrecking him. he ignored it and attacked the boss. kinda reminds me of dps tunneling on boss and ignoring adds in wow and getting RL upset. rofl
[2019-02-22 15:25:32 UTC] pheelme88: @Parks3389 Thank you! I mean games like these are going to take time before perfect like Destiny right?

[2019-02-22 15:26:25 UTC] parks3389: @Pheelme88 That's kinda the problem as a whole, they're reviewing what the game is currently (as they should) rather than "what it could be" with patches a year down the road

[2019-02-22 15:29:46 UTC] tekayla_: omg Towelliee quit WoW for anthem?!

[2019-02-22 16:56:29 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee So far imo, this game came out of the gate strong, but the end game loot system is sorta messed up abit. Hopefully they make legendaries more legendary. Division 2 so far looks promising, because of how they have framed endgame, either way I am enjoying Anthem and haven't logged into wow for a week

[2019-02-22 16:57:14 UTC] zadwanaa: @retrowalker thats actually how i feel too.. but dont forget... Division 1 came out strong and fell flat on its face at 30. Atleast anthem has grandmaster ranks...

[2019-02-22 16:57:15 UTC] retrowalker: they should be yes

[2019-02-22 18:18:34 UTC] zadwanaa: @SuperBrotendo Interesting how the strikes are boring and " end game " strikes are boring. Gambits are moderately fun. I didnt start Destiny on day 1, hence me asking if it had raid on day 1

[2019-02-22 18:18:51 UTC] thekarmazone: @Towelliee Have you had any issues with missions having barriers up so no one can do anything except leave? Missing Arcanist there is an barrier blocking the pathway
[2019-02-22 18:18:51 UTC] grittytexan: Anthem you can actually grind like you can in WoW, D2 raid was released like 2-3 weeks after launch. The only way to grind is to spam the strike system they had and even doing thoughs yu had a pretty low chance of actually getting an upgrade. And as I said before once you did your weekly milestones for the power gear there wasnt much you could do
[2019-02-22 18:19:03 UTC] ezekyler: Horde mode will be fun

[2019-02-22 19:52:24 UTC] the_briggz: downside about ranger is 90% of his MW items are all for melee shit, so dumb
[2019-02-22 19:52:28 UTC] decoythatguy: towelliee is having problems getting MW in GM2 cause he probably has a history of skipping the last boss in the past, and only doing the first to chests.. its his punishment. rofl

[2019-02-22 19:53:34 UTC] ruska21466: How about Interceptor quite many plays that as well. But in my mind Storm and Colossus is most played atm in Anthem.
[2019-02-22 19:53:35 UTC] brovakiin710: shits really good
[2019-02-22 19:53:53 UTC] m4gg0t: i using the ice and fire on my storm
[2019-02-22 19:54:06 UTC] nilbusmaximus: interceptor can only combo once.. and has to wait for Aura to go away.. Colossus can combo nonstop... and storm just does insane damage
[2019-02-22 19:54:33 UTC] m4gg0t: storm is the glass cannon imo

[2019-02-22 21:04:39 UTC] poling622: @m4gg0t sounds good, honestly on Amazon I’m better off going with the 2080 rather than the 1080 for a few hundred more dollars

[2019-02-22 21:09:55 UTC] m4gg0t: @ijuki anthem uses the frostbite engine like BFV which uses AVX instructions

[2019-02-22 21:11:42 UTC] johnnyfive32: @LFMwowgirls yea the herald pistol has 200% increase dmg while hovering it stacked twice if you had two of them equipped
[2019-02-22 21:11:43 UTC] m4gg0t: you can test it out yourself, if you have a BIOS that lets you enable a AVX off set

[2019-02-22 21:12:38 UTC] m4gg0t: lets say your CPU runs at 4.5GHz all cores, if you enable AVX offset to 2, and run BFV or anthem your speed will go down to 4.3GHz

[2019-02-22 21:12:59 UTC] m4gg0t: @poling622 nope theres no way
[2019-02-22 21:13:17 UTC] m4gg0t: anthem like BFV is optimized for multi-core systems
[2019-02-22 21:13:42 UTC] m4gg0t: i know for a fact it can use all 16 threads of a 9900K
[2019-02-22 21:14:04 UTC] poling622: Yea I have intel core i5-6600k @ 3.50GHz and I can’t get under 100% #feelsbadman

[2019-02-22 21:14:09 UTC] m4gg0t: @Towelliee no, its using all cores fine
[2019-02-22 21:14:17 UTC] lemon_king: @m4gg0t Its fine on my Threadripper as far as I can tell.
[2019-02-22 21:14:18 UTC] m4gg0t: thats how its supposed to be
[2019-02-22 21:14:19 UTC] huxiano: well u can just check it with programs ;)
[2019-02-22 21:14:34 UTC] lemon_king: But I may need to check later.
[2019-02-22 21:14:43 UTC] m4gg0t: thats why imo frostbite is one of the better engines
[2019-02-22 21:14:48 UTC] johnnyfive32: its origin being a resource hog with its widgets i believe
[2019-02-22 21:14:53 UTC] m4gg0t: well thats because you have like 28 cores?
[2019-02-22 21:14:55 UTC] mr_moose101: no games utiize all Dem cores lol
[2019-02-22 21:15:00 UTC] lemon_king: 32 >_>

[2019-02-22 21:15:06 UTC] novakhane: lot
[2019-02-22 21:15:09 UTC] crystalyzee: @poling622 have you tried opening the game tabbing out and putting origin to the application setting tab i hear there a bug with frostbyte and doing that can drop cpu usage by 30%

[2019-02-22 21:15:39 UTC] m4gg0t: nah its not a origin bug
[2019-02-22 21:15:43 UTC] m4gg0t: its just the engine
[2019-02-22 21:15:49 UTC] m4gg0t: even BF1 is the same
[2019-02-22 21:15:58 UTC] ciganox: the game is not repetitive?
[2019-02-22 21:16:07 UTC] lemon_king: @m4gg0t I also set the nvidia config panel for forced threading, which I have no idea helps.
[2019-02-22 21:16:09 UTC] crystalyzee: i never had high cpu usage in bf1 like i do in anthem
[2019-02-22 21:16:17 UTC] lemon_king: *if it helps

[2019-02-22 21:16:36 UTC] m4gg0t: well you shouldnt be concern about the CPU usage
[2019-02-22 21:16:43 UTC] m4gg0t: higher usage is better
[2019-02-22 21:16:52 UTC] m4gg0t: means its using the CPU properly
[2019-02-22 21:17:04 UTC] stay_hydrated_bot: @towelliee stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 20 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 80oz (2.40L) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2019-02-22 21:17:12 UTC] ijuki: @m4gg0t not 100% all the time
[2019-02-22 21:17:14 UTC] aaronwells: More usage doesn't mean it is being used properly.
[2019-02-22 21:17:17 UTC] m4gg0t: which means youre not being CPU bound
[2019-02-22 21:17:29 UTC] ijuki: GPU is fine, not CPU
[2019-02-22 21:17:39 UTC] sollice: That's not true @m4gg0t It means the game is being bottlenecked by CPU when it should be utilizing more of the GPU
[2019-02-22 21:17:42 UTC] crystalyzee: yeah but im not trying to prime95 test my cpu for 10hrs a day for 100+ hrs
[2019-02-22 21:17:56 UTC] m4gg0t: not if the engine is optimized properly
[2019-02-22 21:17:59 UTC] sollice: And the problem is it's running high usage on people with high end CPUs which would not bottleneck

[2019-02-22 22:01:45 UTC] medicx21: the tensor core is going to be what replaces former anti alising. it will use DLSS but after the models have been ran through super computers.
[2019-02-22 22:02:08 UTC] m4gg0t: thought DLSS is a RTX feature
[2019-02-22 22:02:10 UTC] medicx21: 1660 ti wont have ray tracing which is really just how lighting works.
[2019-02-22 22:02:25 UTC] m4gg0t: there are different usages for ray tracing
[2019-02-22 22:02:32 UTC] teklyf: What level
[2019-02-22 22:02:38 UTC] medicx21: dlss is not a raytracing feature. raytracing is how the light is bouncing tensor is how the shapes are being rescaled

[2019-02-22 22:03:31 UTC] medicx21: dlss is going to have the games run through a super computer to figure out every possible model. then the game dev will add that in to support dlss. it will put all the anti alising on the AI core leaving more of the GPU available for other functions.

[2019-02-22 22:06:00 UTC] medicx21: @m4gg0t Once a game gets DLSS support though your GPU will not really have to do anything for antialising which has the biggest his on your card right now. it will provide substantial improvements.

[2019-02-22 22:08:09 UTC] medicx21: i think theres only one game with DLSS support right now so you really have nothing to compare it to on what it looks like. and its not a looks think its a performance thing. DLSS on Vs. off provides better performance not visual.

[2019-02-22 22:09:27 UTC] dragonofwolves: You know I'm hoping for a story DLC we get something that goes towards getting our legion of dawn javelin back from owen... jackass doesnt even know how to use it to its fullest
