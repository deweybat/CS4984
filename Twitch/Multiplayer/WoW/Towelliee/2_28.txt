[2019-02-28 13:45:41 UTC] retrowalker: @serving_looks_for_brunch i would recommend you use a Truth of Taris or devastator as your 2nd weapon, freezing grenade together. You can combo alot with that and do aoe. or move to seeker mines. I don't find it too bad dealing with mobs, i build up my combos and beat them down with ultimate

[2019-02-28 14:15:30 UTC] sollice: @towelliee I watched some many videos with people saying Anthem is trash because it was full of microtransactions...then you point out there is like 6 of them you can buy with earned in game gold. then they admit they haven't played it just that its EA so they assume
[2019-02-28 14:15:50 UTC] phaeten: How many games can you name that didn't experience issues at initial release. We've come to expect it.

[2019-02-28 14:16:47 UTC] lugzgaming: Division 2 combat is less flashy but from what I've played it's a bit more satisfying to ME because of it's tactical nature. None of the looter shooters can compete with Anthem in terms of flashiness and abilities.
[2019-02-28 14:16:51 UTC] trafikk_: Division *
[2019-02-28 14:16:51 UTC] esl_cruiser: Yeah. Also another strength of Anthem's is that every javelin feels different. Like there is absolutely diffrent gameplay style with every class
[2019-02-28 14:16:51 UTC] slayd11: ya u prob fucked then for d2 lol
[2019-02-28 14:16:54 UTC] scopedpixels: Comparing Anthem to Div 2 is dumb actually. Totally different gameplay.

[2019-02-28 14:16:59 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee im holding out because everyone is still comparing TD1 to TD2 endgame and they are nothing alike

[2019-02-28 14:17:02 UTC] esl_cruiser: While for example Destiny 2 classes feel mostly the same
[2019-02-28 14:17:06 UTC] konawolfee: This game doesn’t even have end game . So division 1 anthem 0
[2019-02-28 14:17:16 UTC] slayd11: destiny 2 classes feel nothing alike

[2019-02-28 14:18:10 UTC] esl_cruiser: What? The only thing that diffrenciate them are ultimates... I mean sorry but the jump archetype and bland class specific skills hardly count as class differentiantion @Slayd11
[2019-02-28 14:18:14 UTC] legacyoftork: Anthem really only needs more goblins, because goblins are the master race
[2019-02-28 14:18:22 UTC] prey0491: @Towelliee I hear you can fix this bug if your whole team dies. From drowning or something

[2019-02-28 14:18:37 UTC] lugzgaming: For fans of looter shooters they have an embarassment of riches right now in terms of choice.

[2019-02-28 14:21:47 UTC] grittytexan: That was always the problem with the division. I loved the game but it was so boring to watch others play

[2019-02-28 14:21:54 UTC] spyrhdwnas: funny thing is that it all stemmed from UK retail sales where it sold less than andromeda by a huge margin but still was top seller. So UK retails sales should not be an indication in general in this case. I guess hating is easier than thinking.

[2019-02-28 14:23:54 UTC] paindead1: the reason the first one got boring imo was because of the basic mechanics same world and same enemies all day long

[2019-02-28 14:24:36 UTC] esl_cruiser: I hope they'll introduce character stats sheet in the Forge
[2019-02-28 14:24:38 UTC] grittytexan: More or less yes. You can have a fuck ton of damage, health or skill points or a happy median. Plus you can climb a certain skill tree that gives you a shield to walk with and shit. Now I haven't kept up with Division 2 so if they still have that I can not tell you for sure but the first Division they definitely have a tankish build

[2019-02-28 15:03:43 UTC] naightshade: This morning we will be deploying a patch with the following changes: The tethering timer for missions has been increased. Players should now have more time to catch up to their Squad before seeing a countdown timer. The Swarm Tyrant encounter in the Tyrant Mine Stronghold can no longer be reset by the entire Squad exiting to the main menu and rejoining the session in progress. Players are no longer able to reopen chests that have already been looted in Strongholds.

[2019-02-28 15:06:51 UTC] beardedwarrior91: This game can't have been in development for 6 years considering the myriad of things missing.Unique guns? Waypoints? Fast Travel? Loads of Javelin looks? (not just 3 different types of armour). Im not sure the loot changes will make that much of a difference. I hope they give bioware the time to fix this.

[2019-02-28 15:10:55 UTC] lugzgaming: Do Origin members with the $5 plan per month get to play Anthem?
[2019-02-28 15:11:02 UTC] elzz: @towelliee i think anthem actually allowed people to be geared to quickly with limited content masterworks should drop fewer with slightly better rolls
[2019-02-28 15:11:05 UTC] prey0491: Reloading is for rangers
[2019-02-28 15:11:09 UTC] bronloch: @Towelliee which is coming first Flying or Kul'Tiran druids?

[2019-02-28 15:11:26 UTC] aufidius3: Loot is fairly easy to fix since everyone is affected the same way. Connectivity issues are on a case by case basis so it will likely take time.
[2019-02-28 15:11:36 UTC] elzz: @towelliee you only spend a small amount of time to get a masterwork item in wow to get your item you would farm for weeks
[2019-02-28 15:11:43 UTC] dragnonhd: Anthem will be best known for shutting BioWare down

[2019-02-28 15:23:15 UTC] vonhellman: @Insaynee there are slight changes regarding weapon handling and sound which make it way better than d1
[2019-02-28 15:23:18 UTC] duckforceone: @Towelliee i can recommend playing TD2 as a very tactical cover shooter. it becomes so much more fun with walking around and only running during fights..
[2019-02-28 15:23:23 UTC] zuccigame: @Towelliee Wait this says preload is tonight, and it doesnt open beta till 1st?
[2019-02-28 15:23:31 UTC] enigmio: but its still like that LUL
[2019-02-28 15:23:34 UTC] stunlock: I loved that system
[2019-02-28 15:23:34 UTC] lerandcuy84: everyone judging a game before it's even out. actually play the game before making an instant decision of the game
[2019-02-28 15:23:34 UTC] thead_enco: Division is more tactical style of gameplay than anthem
[2019-02-28 15:23:36 UTC] mirtiori: I think they mean damage and health mechanics, which are pretty much the same
[2019-02-28 15:23:36 UTC] bruderen4: @Towelliee For some reason i just lost my half my starter items from the lelgion of dawn edition
[2019-02-28 15:23:42 UTC] vonhellman: @Towelliee that was 1 way to do it lol
[2019-02-28 15:23:43 UTC] grittytexan: Gameplay is almost the acaxt same as the first division nothing really new
[2019-02-28 15:23:45 UTC] geesmiley: so in that case, we'll see you back on anthem :P
[2019-02-28 15:23:48 UTC] zadwanaa: @Towelliee i rebound it to spacebar.. but if you dont like cover to cover... you'll hate it man. I loved it, so thats why im lookin forward to TD2
[2019-02-28 15:23:50 UTC] temezix: hopefully the specializations in TD2 will make the combat more exciting
[2019-02-28 15:23:52 UTC] neounited7: Can you even jump in Division?
[2019-02-28 15:23:52 UTC] octomech: TD1 wasnt REALLY a cover shooter though

[2019-02-28 15:25:07 UTC] zadwanaa: the bullet sponging wasn't a huge issue... hell, it wasnt even a real issue.. just something for people to cry about.
[2019-02-28 15:25:09 UTC] lugzgaming: the builds are way more in depth than Anthem.

[2019-02-28 15:47:40 UTC] thalomus: getting a legendary in this game really is like crack and then the rest of the game is you just getting worse quality crack which makes that addiction for the good crack even worse

[2019-02-28 16:12:20 UTC] camarac: @Towelliee they said it might be an issue with the frostbite engine

[2019-02-28 16:13:04 UTC] xirmak: Yup
[2019-02-28 16:13:06 UTC] alpha_omega_prime: Just means they need to push the engine developer to fix the issue.
[2019-02-28 16:13:10 UTC] sonatta: i'm going to call bullshit on engine based issue... i didn't have sound issues in Andromeda, Battlefield, or Battlefront
[2019-02-28 16:13:16 UTC] spilledmelk: Skyforge had the same sound issue forever on PS4. They finally kinda fixed it a month or 2 ago
[2019-02-28 16:13:24 UTC] at1c: all EA games using frostbite and the plus side EA/DICE made this engine from scratch
[2019-02-28 16:13:28 UTC] thisthc: my update has taken longer to finalize than it took to download the 3gbs LUL

[2019-02-28 16:13:38 UTC] daihenka: If it is an engine issue, they can fix it and send a fix upstream to the frostbyte engine team. Or at the very least, send the issue upstream to the Frostbyte team.
[2019-02-28 16:13:44 UTC] firepong9877: is the sound issue an issue on console as well?

I closed the game, came back in, and it put me in the same instance on the final boss. It looped me several times that way. Got to loot the boss over and over. @Towelliee

[2019-02-28 16:24:35 UTC] dumbfunnycool: @gonzoforce and you updated anthem/origin itself
[2019-02-28 16:24:37 UTC] twostripes: its not like that anymore ^^
[2019-02-28 16:24:38 UTC] mrshilka: div 2 fixed alot of the bullet sponge stuff
[2019-02-28 16:24:40 UTC] lucky8605: All the Levi hate here today...oof
[2019-02-28 16:24:43 UTC] lt_dan_and_his_magic_legs: The Division 1 had really good gunplay, even with the bullet sponges. Leveling up in TD1 was awesome. The problem was that even though the gunplay and movement/cover system was fun, the endgame was WAY WAY OVERTUNED. And so you couldn't enjoy the gunplay because you'd get killed by shotgunners down a hallway.
[2019-02-28 16:24:50 UTC] mahakali: Anthem-Andy ^^
[2019-02-28 16:24:51 UTC] mistercornwallis: But Towelliee, its an epic wife beater with insane stats...

[2019-02-28 16:25:17 UTC] griffgoodman: One Scar on GM3 is more of a bulletsponge than the strongest NPC in Division atm :)

[2019-02-28 16:25:33 UTC] zokson: at least divison have 3x amount of content then anthem
[2019-02-28 16:25:38 UTC] sasinyamada: @throgor69 im loving the gameplay but towel is right about the QOL needing A LOT of work, i think the playerbase is being so adamant about is what the game CAN be with just a few good changes
[2019-02-28 16:25:41 UTC] lt_dan_and_his_magic_legs: When they added the Underground dungeon system and Survival Mode for TD1, the game was how it SHOULD have been on release sadly.
[2019-02-28 16:25:46 UTC] mrshilka: yeah I never went back to div 1 but tried div 2 closed beta and was imoressed
[2019-02-28 16:25:49 UTC] dumbfunnycool: @gonzoforce i would update it just in case because they did have a hidden loot update

[2019-02-28 16:27:07 UTC] griffgoodman: Same goes for Division. With a the endgame gear sets, you could shred through the legendary difficulty

[2019-02-28 16:28:14 UTC] lt_dan_and_his_magic_legs: @Towelliee The thing is about TD1 and TD2, eventually they started releasing set pieces in TD1 that radically changed how you played and I hope they continue that. Being able to carry a riot shield and an SMG and tanking for your team and everytime an enemy hit your shield they got debuffed to take more damage. Or a pyro set that turned your gun turret into a flame turret and you'd see enemies freak and panic and run around on fire.

[2019-02-28 16:30:01 UTC] lugzgaming: Reading some peoples opinions can be so frustraiting. It's like many don't even try to apply nuance. Destiny 2 is trash...Anthem is trash...Division is trash. None of that is even true. There's awesome shit in each of the looter shooters and if your only opinion is "it's trash" then you just can't ben taken seriously

[2019-02-28 16:32:15 UTC] thalomus: @RevoryFTW If they added one I'd probably turn it off tbh haha
[2019-02-28 16:32:37 UTC] lt_dan_and_his_magic_legs: @LugzGaming THe problem isn't that the games are "trash" It's that the developers/higher ups are out of touch with the playerbase. They have an idea/vision of how they game *should* be played and sometimes devs dig their heels in on that. I came from City of Heroes where everyone loved it at launch and the first few months after and then they made radical wide sweeping changes that the playerbase didn't want. And people jumped ship to WoW as a result.
[2019-02-28 16:32:46 UTC] scorpio1401: Yeah that's the thing, if they add the mini map they need to make it an option. I know some people don't like mini maps.

[2019-02-28 16:33:05 UTC] sketchsquadttv: yorue jerky brand mode
[2019-02-28 16:33:05 UTC] hene83: they need to "ladder" the loot system, like first u grind gm1 and then gm2 drops better loot stats etc. then theres a reason to climb to higher gm's

[2019-02-28 16:34:39 UTC] lugzgaming: @Towelliee in some cases that maybe be true but in the context of looter shooters like Warframe, Destiny, Anthem, and DIvision 2 I'm not sure why anyone would think that aobut the devs. Warframe has shown consistent growth. Destiny 2 and Division rebuilt themselves and made amazing games out of poort starts. And Bioware hasn't been given enough time to make a judgement call on them yet.

[2019-02-28 17:49:22 UTC] blood4ng3l: there is a gear next to so it is for the weapon it dose nothing
[2019-02-28 17:49:22 UTC] draacx: @Towelliee that is garbo the cog means for the weapon only

Players should now have more time to catch up to their Squad before seeing a countdown timer. The Swarm Tyrant encounter in the Tyrant Mine Stronghold can no longer be reset by the entire Squad exiting to the main menu and rejoining the session in progress. Players are no longer able to reopen chests that have already been looted in Strongholds.

[2019-02-28 18:23:55 UTC] mightywombat: @Robob they said theres going to be raid in D2, 8 man ones
[2019-02-28 18:23:59 UTC] lucaflow: Still feeling kinda burned from D1 not sure if I'll try D2
[2019-02-28 18:24:03 UTC] frankthebunny: your autocannon shreds
[2019-02-28 18:24:05 UTC] zer0fragz: It’s like the gameplay of anthem is amazing but the content is okay, and then division gameplay might be meh but the content will be good haha I hope the gameplay is good
[2019-02-28 18:24:08 UTC] robob: they did such a good job with combat/flying in this though, that's why i enjoy it
[2019-02-28 18:24:09 UTC] naamtar: @Towelliee apparently they stealth nerfed GM2 and it's a lot easier now, I haven't had a chanc eto get on and test
[2019-02-28 18:24:12 UTC] superlitfam: The core of the combat in Division just isn’t as fun.
[2019-02-28 18:24:17 UTC] radrez: anthem has 10 viewers watching, I love the game but that is sad :P
[2019-02-28 18:24:18 UTC] griffgoodman: division 1 after 1.8 was great
[2019-02-28 18:24:23 UTC] v1z10n_: exactly @SuperLitFam
[2019-02-28 18:24:24 UTC] robob: yeah @MightyWombat I tried the endgame raid test they did
[2019-02-28 18:24:27 UTC] robob: it was good
[2019-02-28 18:24:31 UTC] sonatta: @lucaflow sounds like you didn't play any of the post launch content/patches
[2019-02-28 18:24:32 UTC] naamtar: @Towelliee people in the official Reddit Discord talking about it
[2019-02-28 18:24:42 UTC] grittytexan: Yeah long run division was amazing
[2019-02-28 18:24:53 UTC] mightywombat: @Robob ok, i didnt personally i just played all the other stuff haha, i enjoyed it
[2019-02-28 18:24:53 UTC] acidionis: @Radrez what are you talking about he has over 3k viewers
[2019-02-28 18:24:57 UTC] only1legendary: I just got a LEGENDARY BABY!!!

[2019-02-28 18:25:10 UTC] zer0fragz: @radrez lirikBLIND
[2019-02-28 18:25:15 UTC] insaynee: The Division took well over a year to be even remotely engaging. I expect it to take at least a few months before it's worth playing
[2019-02-28 18:25:16 UTC] afreak10: common and uncommon will stop dropping after patch @Towelliee
[2019-02-28 18:25:17 UTC] radrez: @Acidionis anthem official livestream you doughnut :P

[2019-02-28 18:25:19 UTC] d0cbert: what dificulty is this?
[2019-02-28 18:25:19 UTC] robob: yeah i didn't have too much time with it but I enjoyed the 1-2 runs. I just hope i can do it for 2-50 runs lol
[2019-02-28 18:25:25 UTC] only1legendary: @Towelliee No by my self :)
[2019-02-28 18:25:39 UTC] derviktim: Looks like the loot fix isn't in yet. BW said whites and greens were getting removed from the loot pool at level 30.
[2019-02-28 18:25:42 UTC] lucaflow: I played a couple of patches but honestly after going through that early period I just didn't want to go back
[2019-02-28 18:25:42 UTC] nihalistic_bat: do you have 2 now? name invalid
[2019-02-28 18:25:51 UTC] yarze: @DerViktim tomorrow

[2019-02-28 18:28:55 UTC] superlitfam: Madpool86 you know the patch has t been applied yet, right?
[2019-02-28 18:28:56 UTC] robert_sigi: EA forum is under maintenance, but my guess is they use other servers for that.
[2019-02-28 18:29:03 UTC] uyrtoss: is it normal that every quickplay mission is bugged?
[2019-02-28 18:29:07 UTC] 3dres: @Yarze that's kind of disappointing. Thanks for letting me know
[2019-02-28 18:29:08 UTC] acidionis: 3 but one is a quest mission remade...the other you get early..
[2019-02-28 18:29:11 UTC] xlr8_trissie: I feel like the tyrant mine is way faster

[2019-02-28 18:29:19 UTC] xlr8_trissie: Especially if your killing the boss
[2019-02-28 18:29:23 UTC] masteroftheskum: @UyrToss sometimes quest wont show you marker till everyone joins in quickplay

[2019-02-28 18:29:51 UTC] valgus_92: @Towelliee The easiest workaround I've found for broken quickplays is to just do them on Easy - mostly newbs doing story missions that aren't bugged.
[2019-02-28 18:30:00 UTC] superlitfam: @madpool86 no idea but patch is not live yet either way
[2019-02-28 18:30:01 UTC] uyrtoss: @MasterOfTheSkum I either have those or the objective is immune
[2019-02-28 18:30:03 UTC] nihalistic_bat: @madpool86 Patch notes are available.. but it was exploit fixes
[2019-02-28 18:30:12 UTC] acidionis: I like the boss battle for scars temple even though most don't .....heart of rage is horribly hard....i can do GM2 on the others but have troubles with hard at times on HoR
[2019-02-28 18:30:16 UTC] madpool86: ok thx guys
[2019-02-28 18:30:27 UTC] hardmanmagnus: @Towelliee had several missions bug on hard

[2019-02-28 18:30:43 UTC] ptkiska: a white POG
[2019-02-28 18:30:47 UTC] nihalistic_bat: Heart of rage isn't hard as much as the monitor has a metric fuck ton of health

[2019-02-28 18:31:25 UTC] uyrtoss: @MasterOfTheSkum yeah I didn't even notice since I joined in and was wondering why everyone is leaving
[2019-02-28 18:31:26 UTC] whymodswhy_: Acidionis They didnt apply the patch yet ?
[2019-02-28 18:31:35 UTC] acidionis: @whymodswhy_ no or else he wouldn't have got greens
[2019-02-28 18:31:47 UTC] robert_sigi: So EA has to apply the new(est) patch first and THEN open the servers for people to play?! :P
[2019-02-28 18:31:52 UTC] whymodswhy_: Acidionis I just got an update for 3 Gb :'(
[2019-02-28 18:31:53 UTC] acidionis: they put the hotfix through that fixed some exploits but NOT the loot patch
[2019-02-28 18:31:55 UTC] gorcossax: Towelliees look on his face when he realized it was a green
[2019-02-28 18:31:57 UTC] gorcossax: lol
[2019-02-28 18:32:03 UTC] grittytexan: Do contracts keep resetting for anyone else? Also aren't you supposed to get a MW at the end of your completed contract on GM1?
[2019-02-28 18:32:05 UTC] acidionis: @whymodswhy_ see above

[2019-02-28 18:32:46 UTC] damienistoxic: @Towelliee was going to say probably the one with the plus sign lol

[2019-02-28 18:35:06 UTC] naightshade: Bugged I guess
[2019-02-28 18:35:07 UTC] daihenka: GM2 gives you an increased chance for MW/Legos. So yes, it should give you more of a base than GM1.

[2019-02-28 18:36:21 UTC] daihenka: @Dethmold187 then their descriptions for GM1-3 are completely wrong in teh game
[2019-02-28 18:36:25 UTC] nastyburns: glad you didnt equip consumables
[2019-02-28 18:36:28 UTC] broomba: That was the fastest expedition ever @towelliee
[2019-02-28 18:36:32 UTC] dethmold187: @Acidionis It's what the Developers said, if you disagree, please go and tell them they don't know their own game :)
[2019-02-28 18:36:39 UTC] acidionis: @Dethmold187 look at the description in the game lol. Plus it was stated BY bioware that its Difficulty + luck + difficulty of target
[2019-02-28 18:36:52 UTC] masteroftheskum: @Towelliee Ps4 patch really fucked my game up have been through 4 continuous load screens that lock up at 90 % patches ftw

[2019-02-28 18:37:17 UTC] dethmold187: That is why everyone is farming GM1, because it's faster and it has the same loot drop chances
[2019-02-28 18:37:23 UTC] liberategeorge: only experienced players in this stream Kappa
[2019-02-28 18:37:26 UTC] gebrant: Wow that was a great spawn
[2019-02-28 18:37:28 UTC] mightywombat: from what i read and understood from the ingame diff, was that GM1 mastery opens the loot table but higher diff, gives a better chance of MW and lego's
[2019-02-28 18:37:46 UTC] acidionis: @Dethmold187 please feel free to message me the link to that....I can link to you where they deny that ;)

[2019-02-28 18:38:31 UTC] radrez: at least its guaranteed to give you a masterwork :)
[2019-02-28 18:38:40 UTC] nasilvera: @mammasbois Did you get a quest to complete some trials?

[2019-02-28 19:19:01 UTC] acidionis: Yeah....i love how one of the biggest complaints of Anthem is that enemies on harder difficulties are just bigger bullet sponges.....have they played wow? :P. Although I do like how wow adds more "mechanics" on harder difficulties

[2019-02-28 19:20:06 UTC] ptkiska: Division 2 is literally just an expansion to div 1 but is more satisfying to play imo than div1

[2019-02-28 19:21:37 UTC] getitonthelow: is update live?
[2019-02-28 19:21:38 UTC] zadwanaa: Division 2 is the same as Destiny 2... just a glorified expansion of a pre-existing game with a slightly changed story. If you liked the first, you'll like the 2nd. Its a second shot at fixing the game
[2019-02-28 19:21:47 UTC] uglyfoot: Had to reinstall Anthem because the update filled up my SSD. Anthem file was up to 86 gigs...
[2019-02-28 19:22:03 UTC] ascended696: @Zadwanaa Lol did you play div 1? The gameplay is totally different... from pvp to pve
[2019-02-28 19:22:14 UTC] odtu: yeah they gotta fix the updating mechanism
[2019-02-28 19:22:16 UTC] puffnbuff: Its not totally different tbh

[2019-02-28 19:22:38 UTC] redapple926: They didn't want to release GM2 or 3 because the loot tables weren't set up,,,,,but everyone knew about them already so they didn't want bad feedback by not releasing them at launch @Towelliee

[2019-02-28 19:23:44 UTC] cynical_titan: @towelliee doesn’t GM2 guarantee 2 masterworks per run and GM3 3 masterworks?
[2019-02-28 19:23:46 UTC] loldotcom: that means we're supposed to be surprised by a GM4 when it comes out?

[2019-02-28 19:24:15 UTC] zadwanaa: @ascended696 exactly. You just proved my point. Division 2 is a glorified expansion of Division 1. Just like Destiny.
[2019-02-28 19:24:21 UTC] dethmold187: @Cynical_titan GM 1 -3 have the same loot drop chances
[2019-02-28 19:24:21 UTC] mikegggames: @Puffnbuff terrible logic, but you do you
[2019-02-28 19:24:23 UTC] elzz: they should make legendary percentages and master work percentages higher in gm2 and 3 to give incentive to do
[2019-02-28 19:24:26 UTC] gebrant: All they would have to do is cosmetics you can only get for stuff in GM1 and GM2 @Towelliee
[2019-02-28 19:24:28 UTC] acidionis: and GM3 should have a very small chance of epics ;)
[2019-02-28 19:24:34 UTC] gebrant: GM3*

[2019-02-28 19:24:57 UTC] ascended696: @Zadwanaa Every wow expac has been the same rehashed thing.... w/e done arguing have fun m8... It's definitely not the same... I've played div1 for 2k hours... Put another 60 in alpha and closed beta... it's def not the same
[2019-02-28 19:25:03 UTC] puffnbuff: the new grenades etc for the 2nd game is fun, but its really not that big of a difference compaird to Div 1 :)

[2019-02-28 19:27:59 UTC] zadwanaa: @ascended696 Division 1 was more bullet spongy, yea. Duh. Division 2 isn't.. mobs are different... but the Physics are the same, the core concept is the same. the gear is " different " but its still just a glorified expansion. Granted a decently overhaul but not exactly a new game. Destiny 2 did the same. But we can all agree, TCTD:2 looks amazing and i cant wait for it to drop
[2019-02-28 19:28:02 UTC] ashes2ashestv: It takes some time to determine the drops
[2019-02-28 19:28:05 UTC] loldotcom: its not even just quickplay, its the base game. missions break way too often

[2019-02-28 19:29:13 UTC] ascended696: @Zadwanaa I can agree on that... but it's not the same. Everything about div2 is better than div 1

[2019-02-28 19:29:47 UTC] ashes2ashestv: haha you have to give luck more time. You can't determine it from 2 runs
[2019-02-28 19:29:54 UTC] acidionis: wait a second....i never see heads get blown off.....even when i finish with a head shot.....how'd you do that? :P
[2019-02-28 19:30:04 UTC] zadwanaa: @ascended696 Everything about Legion was better than Warlords... but its still an expansion. Massive overhauls, but same game. Different mobs, same game. its not a big deal, dont need to get defensive over it. You can love something and still admit its faults

[2019-02-28 19:32:00 UTC] acidionis: So, the other day I was laying sniper rounds into the back weak point on one of those big guys....by myself....it was glitched and wouldn't turn around. I got him to half health and the container exploded and killed him. So it looks like SOME weak points not only do more damage but also if you lay into them enough can just outright explode and take out the guy early
[2019-02-28 19:32:07 UTC] zadwanaa: @LOLdotCOM no, its not. Because its an expansion. Just because you throw a " 2 " on something doesnt mean its a new game. Might just mean its a new shot at the same game. Which isnt a bad idea. Division 1 had potential and dropped it but picked it back up. I hope they dont drop it in the TD:1

[2019-02-28 19:33:52 UTC] acidionis: luck
[2019-02-28 19:33:58 UTC] zetseun: looking at how often they throw patches out, not much will improve by the first major update
[2019-02-28 19:34:03 UTC] acidionis: just "Luck + 20*" etc
[2019-02-28 19:34:09 UTC] yarze: @neolust1 its support luck
[2019-02-28 19:34:16 UTC] acidionis: if its "Support Luck + 20%" it is not really luck
[2019-02-28 19:34:21 UTC] insaynee: What rolls/secondary stats are you looking for, @Towelliee
[2019-02-28 19:34:29 UTC] acidionis: "support luck" is the chance of ammo and health drops

[2019-02-28 19:35:08 UTC] acidionis: and what is supply @Yarze
[2019-02-28 19:35:21 UTC] yarze: supply is chance to drop ammo

[2019-02-28 19:35:23 UTC] zadwanaa: But either way, each wow xpac is just that... TD:2 is advertised as a new game but its just a glorified xpac. Not a bad thing... they really needed to a second shot... they dropped the ball on the first game but picked up late. I hope they learned from that and make TD:2 amazing
[2019-02-28 19:35:25 UTC] loldotcom: @jb_8000 the internal modifier just stops working at that level
[2019-02-28 19:35:28 UTC] zetseun: it is true
[2019-02-28 19:35:32 UTC] yarze: repair is chance to drop health
[2019-02-28 19:35:35 UTC] jb_8000: interesting
[2019-02-28 19:35:36 UTC] acidionis: @Yarze according to the dev response its the chance to drop ammo AND health
[2019-02-28 19:35:36 UTC] neolust1: so it is support inscription with luck?

[2019-02-28 19:36:20 UTC] zadwanaa: @zetseun why would they? thats odd... they should take some suggestions and some tips...
[2019-02-28 19:36:33 UTC] mightywombat: i have like 1 mod that has just plain luck lol
[2019-02-28 19:36:34 UTC] zadwanaa: but its their game. if it were from the fanbase.. the game would suck
[2019-02-28 19:36:36 UTC] yarze: I agree WF is boring to watch
[2019-02-28 19:36:37 UTC] zetseun: that's what i'm saying zadwanaa
[2019-02-28 19:36:48 UTC] insaynee: Anthem devs are doing a solid job. Unfortunately, Massive/Ubi aren't anywhere near as good at communicating as Bioware so I expect the launch of TD2 to be just as rocky
[2019-02-28 19:36:48 UTC] thoomerry: Anthem looks great not sure my 970gtx would cope tho

[2019-02-28 19:38:20 UTC] mightywombat: so the "luck" you want is just called luck, and NOT support: luck

[2019-02-28 19:48:05 UTC] waguisan: like mark as trash in division
[2019-02-28 19:48:07 UTC] blanke_: should be right click to mark as junk and f to salvage junk
[2019-02-28 19:48:10 UTC] datboijakey: or instantly get rid of all things that dont have a certain requirement you set?
[2019-02-28 19:48:12 UTC] armath_: If you mark it as junk you can mass salvage no?
[2019-02-28 19:48:14 UTC] merex760: yeah that would make too much sense Kappa
[2019-02-28 19:48:16 UTC] mindwarpvelen: Press F to pay salvages
[2019-02-28 19:48:20 UTC] st_money: choose what you want, salvage the rest
[2019-02-28 19:48:33 UTC] mightywombat: wouldnt it just be faster to mark what you wanted to keep and salvage whats not marked? usally you get shitloads of junk :P
[2019-02-28 19:48:53 UTC] blanke_: Ya true that way might be better haha
[2019-02-28 19:48:54 UTC] asystolic: F
[2019-02-28 19:48:57 UTC] strange_brewz: and the mark as junk, then mass salvage, has a bit of lag while it moves it.. so its not any faster
[2019-02-28 19:49:01 UTC] keepitwheel: yeah throwing things from the vault into the junk tab takes just as long to do .Like you click move to junk a full 2 seconds later it moves it well in that 2 seconds i could of just salvage the one item then moved on ... junk tab = waste of time
[2019-02-28 19:49:40 UTC] odtu: diablo 2 had salvage blues back in 1999
[2019-02-28 19:49:46 UTC] mightywombat: one QOL i saw in Division 2 was to salvage armor/weapon on the group instead of having to pick it up to do so
