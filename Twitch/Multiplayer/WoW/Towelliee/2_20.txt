[2019-02-20 03:49:16 UTC] diggestbickest: I guess I should ask do you think the game is fun enough to put that many hours in?
[2019-02-20 03:49:40 UTC] aethn: Dont forget lifetime free DLC's too
[2019-02-20 03:50:04 UTC] diggestbickest: I tend to enjoy the same games you play so I def validate ur opinion I appreciate it towels
[2019-02-20 03:50:09 UTC] gyxxer: better than destiny if u had to make a comparison?
[2019-02-20 03:50:23 UTC] cirewho: anthem is a cool looking game but holy crap the motion sickness kicked in full force when i tested an early version of the game. had to pass on buying.
[2019-02-20 03:50:47 UTC] aethn: Destiny was good becuase I could buy all eh expansions and seasons for WoW tokens hehe

[2019-02-20 03:51:47 UTC] aethn: its buy to play but if you have EA premiere you get free access
[2019-02-20 03:52:08 UTC] aethn: if you drop EA premier you lose access

[2019-02-20 03:52:59 UTC] cirewho: it's sort of like the xbox game pass. you get a bunch of games if you pay monthly for it or you dont have to have the pass and you can buy the game for retail with no monthly fee
[2019-02-20 03:53:25 UTC] theplayinplayer: new crackdown 3 for game pass
[2019-02-20 03:53:39 UTC] reemius: I dont know if its just me but looter shooters are defiantly more fun with a regular crew, esp when like in anthem there is no text based chat

[2019-02-20 03:55:22 UTC] teritoesx: @Reemius and I agree they've made their mistakes - but they've actually done a lot better recently, players too busy hatin to notice
[2019-02-20 03:56:05 UTC] reemius: @TeritoESX us gamers tend to remember the bad and not recognise the good unfortunately

[2019-02-20 03:56:47 UTC] phaeten: Also you get the highest version of the game, so you actually get the most expensive version of the game.
[2019-02-20 03:58:10 UTC] reemius: i wish anthem came out later in the year tbh, as im a huge division fan and 2 looter shooters at the same time... good god! id prolly end up with a divorce hahaha

[2019-02-20 04:03:10 UTC] reemius: sadly i always considered destiny 2 as destiny 0.5 it seemed to go backwards was insane
[2019-02-20 04:04:09 UTC] sofunny1111: the concept of division is great they just don't develop it enought i played the first one alot and every new content was done in a hour
[2019-02-20 04:04:19 UTC] reemius: alot of the systems seemed to go backwards, taken king patch in d1 was great, yet destiny 2 seemed to go back before that patch

[2019-02-20 04:04:46 UTC] reemius: i think the thing that kept (keeps) me going with the division is the pvp tbh
[2019-02-20 04:05:29 UTC] sofunny1111: same, but at one point farming the same thing over and over to get nothing gets kind of sad too

[2019-02-20 04:06:41 UTC] reemius: oh god yeh, i tend to get that feeling in most looters tbh. Im hoping the 8 man raids in div 2 are done good and have actual mechanics
[2019-02-20 04:06:49 UTC] reemius: not just waves of mobs
[2019-02-20 04:07:53 UTC] sofunny1111: yes i hope so a lot, because in division one it was all the same, hide behind cover spray, heals and push in every dungeons or encounter..
[2019-02-20 04:08:04 UTC] reemius: i think the hardest thing when designing a looter is having enough content for everyone, but also not making it so players feel they have to do things they dont like
[2019-02-20 04:08:39 UTC] restlessx25: I'm so sad none of my friends play this game anymore FeelsBadMan

[2019-02-20 04:48:37 UTC] themanz89: VR is the same as 3D was for movies. Never really took off
[2019-02-20 04:48:57 UTC] reemius: content just gets consumed way to fast these days
[2019-02-20 04:48:58 UTC] hilariousmax: VR needs like 10 more years of innovation

[2019-02-20 04:49:10 UTC] reemius: devs cant keep up
[2019-02-20 04:49:14 UTC] linvoni: I see the return of major solo skill based fps doom quake etc. because team games are on their way out (Overwatch as an example) and other games that FORCE teamwork
[2019-02-20 04:49:20 UTC] monthud: vrs are unapeeling because of the huge thing on your head
[2019-02-20 04:49:27 UTC] 1backwood: They realeased the VR way to early we need to go back to PSP lol
[2019-02-20 04:49:48 UTC] 1backwood: I bet if they released the PSP now people would go nuts ! Portable Playstation WOAHHHH
[2019-02-20 04:49:58 UTC] ren_zo: speaking of pleasure, whats up with VR porn. hows that going
[2019-02-20 04:50:08 UTC] essadis: There has been an increase of "reviews" that just take a "shock" news and just influences the broad audience into adopting an "I don't like this!!" mentality. Anthem for instance, it wasn't a horrible soft launch, and I'm digging it. 30 hours in and I say it's worth the "$60 value"
[2019-02-20 04:50:15 UTC] linvoni: you right
[2019-02-20 04:50:23 UTC] monthud: WTF LUL i remeber that

[2019-02-20 04:51:39 UTC] n0xiker: sure because now is free
[2019-02-20 04:51:43 UTC] 1backwood: Rarely any CSGO lobbies , takes 3-5 min to get into a Dust 2 match
[2019-02-20 04:51:44 UTC] n0xiker: more hackers
[2019-02-20 04:51:44 UTC] mgweirdo: I still think VR can work, but you'll need another generation or so of PCs.. I mean, I'm running WoW and stuff on a 10 yo box. no way I'll be able to run VR. House upgrades take priority for next couple years

[2019-02-20 04:52:31 UTC] catof9lives: dont have hope in pantheon?
[2019-02-20 04:52:32 UTC] monthud: and take mmo rpg genre with it
[2019-02-20 04:52:35 UTC] 1backwood: Mont it is already the greatest MMO and will always be
[2019-02-20 04:52:58 UTC] 1backwood: Ive never seen so many people play Runescape and WoW in my life ... years and years and years of gameplay and there is so much more
[2019-02-20 04:53:16 UTC] 1backwood: So many quests and side quests
[2019-02-20 04:53:25 UTC] essadis: at some point, games like Destiny, Anthem, Division, will find a way to make it a bigger. to make it on a scale of how we know MMOs today.
[2019-02-20 04:53:32 UTC] monthud: ya only like 5 people in the world have every achivment in wow
[2019-02-20 04:53:35 UTC] monthud: probally alittle more
[2019-02-20 04:53:46 UTC] 1backwood: Runescape i dont even think is beatable lol
[2019-02-20 04:53:47 UTC] monthud: and there still missing stuff
[2019-02-20 04:53:49 UTC] linvoni: Yea to be 100% honest once WoW dies (when our granchildren are born) thats gonna probably be RIP for mmos
[2019-02-20 04:53:54 UTC] 1backwood: Too much to do , alot of grinding
[2019-02-20 04:54:21 UTC] reemius: People have put so much time into the current mmos on the market its hard to lure that player base to a new mmo. People are attached to their characters / communities. A new mmo would have to try to lure in people who have not played mmo's before to be viable i think.
[2019-02-20 04:54:27 UTC] 1backwood: IMO MMO's will always be in the gaming community they will never die really . Just like FPS games its a genre of gaming .
[2019-02-20 04:54:45 UTC] luxuryrubbish: Colts super bowl next year

[2019-02-20 04:56:06 UTC] reemius: wow dies once its sub cash flow is overtaken by the upkeep cost
[2019-02-20 04:56:07 UTC] blastaho: Anthem is cool what do think of it life spam

[2019-02-20 05:11:02 UTC] getafixplays: cant*
[2019-02-20 05:11:08 UTC] essadis: Ashes of Kappa
[2019-02-20 05:11:13 UTC] monthud: mmos are also hard to make because they have to compete with wow
[2019-02-20 05:11:20 UTC] deceptiveragemonkey: Blend Black Desert Online and WoW
[2019-02-20 05:11:24 UTC] thomas_jack: Exactly, the only reason classic/tbc were so legit was because it was new. We had to learn everything from scratch. They can't replicate that noob experience for wow
[2019-02-20 05:11:31 UTC] linvoni: here's how blizzard makes mad money make classic a once purchase expansion lower that const of current subscriptions badabing badaboom
[2019-02-20 05:11:43 UTC] linvoni: cost*
[2019-02-20 05:11:44 UTC] themanz89: I love the idea that it can take one stroke of genius and a really good sequence of patches in wow, to make it really really good again
[2019-02-20 05:11:49 UTC] weezmc: well the IP is a great starting line and they have 2 that are basically going no where, I'd love to play a SC marine in a fps
[2019-02-20 05:12:04 UTC] amdarine: MMOs are expensive to publish AND to maintain. There's no reason for a company to make MMOs over BRs for example.
[2019-02-20 05:12:20 UTC] deniussb: Legion wasn't perfect untill NIghthold I Would say
[2019-02-20 05:12:23 UTC] monthud: legion changed the game tho with mythic plus
[2019-02-20 05:12:24 UTC] melteoc: 7.2.5 hit the spot for Legion
[2019-02-20 05:12:25 UTC] swordart_19: i liked legion from start
[2019-02-20 05:12:30 UTC] shunixthegreat: i know a lot of people that come back to try every new expansion and or big patch

[2019-02-20 05:13:27 UTC] sorrel_n: Blizz has gotten to the point it can develop content fast enough to prevent massive droughts. But they are clearly still struggling on progression systems through the entire game
[2019-02-20 05:13:49 UTC] monthud: there feels like no path of progression right now in wow aha
[2019-02-20 05:13:54 UTC] deniussb: I kind of don't mind a drought once in awhile
[2019-02-20 05:14:03 UTC] deniussb: For example Antorus semi-drought
[2019-02-20 05:14:03 UTC] swordart_19: I want Mage Tower 2.0 and azerite armor /neck like Artifact weapons
[2019-02-20 05:14:04 UTC] monthud: aslong as more rain comes Kappa
[2019-02-20 05:14:23 UTC] jukew: i mean, with how much money they make and how popular WoW is, that's natural
[2019-02-20 05:14:33 UTC] cofferun: Reckon blizz need to stick to makin raids, its what they are best at imo, warfronts and islands dont work for me

[2019-02-20 05:14:54 UTC] shunixthegreat: to be fair blizzard keep tryin things new as far as content sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt but they are trying
[2019-02-20 05:14:57 UTC] melteoc: i like the new shit, hardly think on the old, i love change
[2019-02-20 05:14:58 UTC] therealying: TRUE
[2019-02-20 05:14:59 UTC] swordart_19: i like islands pvp once great
[2019-02-20 05:15:01 UTC] deniussb: I think people will never ben happy because they are people
[2019-02-20 05:15:02 UTC] mgweirdo: there are so many different populations in MMOs that you literally can't keep them all happy. What one group loves the next group hates
[2019-02-20 05:15:04 UTC] deniussb: be*
[2019-02-20 05:15:08 UTC] weezmc: ah the skill pruning, or skill gate pruning
[2019-02-20 05:15:19 UTC] orrxxy: if they can give us transfeer to extra power mode in combat i think its work
[2019-02-20 05:15:24 UTC] hakunamateo: amen on legendaries
[2019-02-20 05:15:29 UTC] pelezinho86: Artefact Weapons where great
[2019-02-20 05:15:30 UTC] chronoit: Legendaries were the worst
[2019-02-20 05:15:31 UTC] stickyrwar: Legiondaries were nothing more than epics tbh
[2019-02-20 05:15:34 UTC] s1k_: i just find it hillarious that the same people bitching about bfa are the same people that just like to bitch about everything every expansion - lol
[2019-02-20 05:15:34 UTC] deniussb: Yea and people complained about that too
[2019-02-20 05:15:36 UTC] morehardcore: id disagree on legendaries. They were awful until 7.2
[2019-02-20 05:15:38 UTC] swordart_19: LEgendaries were top
[2019-02-20 05:15:38 UTC] deniussb: People are never happy
[2019-02-20 05:15:42 UTC] makeway4justice: rip tier sets :(
[2019-02-20 05:15:43 UTC] snup78: mythic + ruined raiding
[2019-02-20 05:15:46 UTC] ubrklutch: They got rid of legendaries because it was "TOO RNG"
[2019-02-20 05:15:51 UTC] zonny93: legendaries were shit until you got your BiS
[2019-02-20 05:15:53 UTC] rich3023: I want wrath talents back
[2019-02-20 05:15:53 UTC] swordart_19: @Snup78 LIes i do both
[2019-02-20 05:15:59 UTC] morehardcore: artifact weapons + mythic + were the best part of legion
[2019-02-20 05:16:00 UTC] sorrel_n: Guarantee next expansion people will be complaining they want Azerite armor back. It's going to be hilarious
[2019-02-20 05:16:04 UTC] deniussb: true
[2019-02-20 05:16:08 UTC] ddozuh: it is though
[2019-02-20 05:16:15 UTC] snup78: @swordart_19 if you dont raid mythic why do raid mythic + give better loot
[2019-02-20 05:16:15 UTC] themanz89: BibleThump
[2019-02-20 05:16:25 UTC] chevmaro: Nobody will complain about not having az armor.
[2019-02-20 05:16:26 UTC] monthud: blizzard is like that kid trying to impress his parents Kappa
[2019-02-20 05:16:32 UTC] jukew: the fact that those legendaries had such an impact in your character is what made system bad
[2019-02-20 05:16:33 UTC] monthud: keeps coming back
[2019-02-20 05:16:34 UTC] moardmg11: Kappa

[2019-02-20 05:16:41 UTC] gear_jammer: I wouldn't mind getting them back with sargeras power for like the last fight in a raid tier
[2019-02-20 05:16:43 UTC] deniussb: whats wrong with Azerite armor
[2019-02-20 05:16:45 UTC] pelezinho86: class halls and story where great
[2019-02-20 05:16:45 UTC] fullpurpz: If they could find the right balance between wotlk and bc for classes I think it would be great and they just need to focus on content creation instead of overhauling classes all the time and pruning everything
[2019-02-20 05:16:54 UTC] deniussb: you want 2 and 4 set boring shit
[2019-02-20 05:16:59 UTC] fullpurpz: no fun to have to choose between talents that you had as baseline a few years ago
[2019-02-20 05:17:00 UTC] deniussb: if the set sucks you suck
[2019-02-20 05:17:00 UTC] morehardcore: dude wotlk and cata were the best
[2019-02-20 05:17:03 UTC] s1k_: i actually like azerite traits - they just need to not be tied to the level of your neck
[2019-02-20 05:17:09 UTC] snup78: @swordart_19 my fun comes from getting rewarded :(
[2019-02-20 05:17:16 UTC] hakunamateo: wow peaked for me in Wrath, being a druid felt amazing, truly important to shapeshift etc
[2019-02-20 05:17:20 UTC] shunixthegreat: bc was best
[2019-02-20 05:17:30 UTC] deniussb: Theres no talents that were baseline from Azrerite LMFAO
[2019-02-20 05:17:32 UTC] monthud: druids were like worshiped in wrath
[2019-02-20 05:17:33 UTC] melteoc: @swordart_19 dont waste you time with him, i get you got nothing from my raid 2night still had fun
[2019-02-20 05:17:35 UTC] chevmaro: WOTLK best x-pack ever produced, fact.
[2019-02-20 05:17:43 UTC] weezmc: raid keying in BC wasn't fun tho

[2019-02-20 05:18:53 UTC] swordart_19: I like wod quests not garrisons tho and lack of content at the end
[2019-02-20 05:18:55 UTC] monthud: raids where good in WoD tho

[2019-02-20 05:19:30 UTC] monthud: do you usually wipe on this boss?
[2019-02-20 05:19:53 UTC] sorrel_n: If WoW could just get progression systems and class designs that are permanent and don't need complete overhauls every expansion they could focus so much more on other stuff

[2019-02-20 05:21:17 UTC] jukew: class overhauls is part of what makes every expansion a new experience

[2019-02-20 05:22:35 UTC] sorrel_n: Other MMOs keep classes interesting without overhauling them by just adding more options in how you play them. ESO just adds new skill trees so the possible way to play expands, but the basics all stay the same

[2019-02-20 14:51:25 UTC] silvikian: no, the used cars the dealer normally gets at auction or during trade in and the mark up is always high
[2019-02-20 14:51:27 UTC] haxzorjimduggan: its because they paid chicken shit money for that trade in, they clean it up for nothing raise the price a few thousand and boom more than a new car

[2019-02-20 15:29:12 UTC] scathell: I like Anthem, its a good game, but the loading screens do turn me of. I'm lvl 27 atm, and looking forward to more,but yeah, the difference in loading times sometimes makes me miss half the stuff
[2019-02-20 15:29:28 UTC] stawnchy: Whole reason im here instead of finishing the story is because the last mission bugged out halfway thru
[2019-02-20 15:29:29 UTC] headofnixon: The pace of play for anthem is a big turn off for me.
[2019-02-20 15:29:34 UTC] mrgattz: @scathell being fixed day one patch.

[2019-02-20 15:29:56 UTC] mrgattz: we are still kinda playing a beta
[2019-02-20 15:30:13 UTC] sollice: I honestly don't see much of the loading time issue. I think it's dumb that when someone gets farther in the mission then you are it FORCES you to catch up by loading you in to them

[2019-02-20 15:30:32 UTC] hydralick: i got anthem yesterday... lvl 8 now... i like the game... has lots of bugs still... but, i can look past them and looking forward to more content... they just need to fix load screens and match making

[2019-02-20 16:50:55 UTC] vasherls: but if youre farming gear it is only efficient to do the first 2 chests on Scar
[2019-02-20 16:51:09 UTC] dragnoff: It drops one piece of gear not worth the time investment imo
[2019-02-20 16:51:14 UTC] xyr3s: but i think in the day 1 patch they are going to make it so it shows the loot drop when the boss is killed as well
[2019-02-20 16:51:16 UTC] jimmyjiim: Faster to just do the two chests. One loot pool so why go through that last boss fight? Takes far too long
[2019-02-20 16:51:25 UTC] reactable: they have a lot of bugs to fix also

[2019-02-20 16:52:17 UTC] dewars: Don't you think EA fucked up the hype with early access?
[2019-02-20 16:52:22 UTC] thelazerblade: I also got my first legendary in a random contract didn't even know it was there. It kind of killed the excitement.
[2019-02-20 16:52:26 UTC] sollice: Are Legndaries and Masterwork items on fixed stats, or are they rando as well
[2019-02-20 16:52:48 UTC] mileskg21: i think they are rando like wow stats
[2019-02-20 16:52:48 UTC] thelazerblade: @Sollice rando
[2019-02-20 16:52:48 UTC] azzudin: their inscriptions are random

[2019-02-20 16:53:24 UTC] drmeatmissile: is the taunt ability useless in fights? @Towelliee I don't see anyone running it.
[2019-02-20 16:53:24 UTC] dublg8150: Because there’s all the chest in the enviroment too
[2019-02-20 16:53:24 UTC] darealist83: @sollice the main stat buff is fixed but the inscrptions below are rando
[2019-02-20 16:53:26 UTC] thelazerblade: the endgame would be terribly short if legendaries didnt have random inscriptions

[2019-02-20 16:56:15 UTC] darealist83: best way to farm is quickplay strongholds on easy. you're basically helping low lvl players on easy so you hard carry them through in like 10 and get dumb loot. very affective

[2019-02-20 16:58:26 UTC] thelazerblade: with the design of the game I cant see them having raids, at least as i define a raid anyways.

[2019-02-20 16:58:39 UTC] smurfsgonebad: yes

[2019-02-20 16:59:11 UTC] havoks085: can you party w/ randos or do you need to party w/ friends
[2019-02-20 16:59:12 UTC] flexxy: this game WILL be good , its not any good at its state atm
[2019-02-20 16:59:13 UTC] klickzty: getting epics is so nonsence right now
[2019-02-20 16:59:17 UTC] reactable: i just lob acid and targets melt
[2019-02-20 16:59:20 UTC] thelazerblade: division didnt have raids imo their incursions werent what i consider a raid
[2019-02-20 16:59:31 UTC] mileskg21: its close enough for me :P
[2019-02-20 16:59:41 UTC] darealist83: i think 6 would be a good # for raids

[2019-02-20 17:03:08 UTC] civtac: Is gm3 even possible atm? it's a huuge jump from gm2 and the loot does not get any stronger

[2019-02-20 17:03:51 UTC] flexxy: takes just alot of time
[2019-02-20 17:04:01 UTC] badfair: @towelliee If the game wasn't so buggy, i think GM 2 would be less difficult, some of the bugs make the fights really very difficult
[2019-02-20 17:04:08 UTC] thelazerblade: fulkl masterwork GM3 isnt that bad with a 4 man group
[2019-02-20 17:04:34 UTC] drmeatmissile: standing in fire should regen health for a cool perk

[2019-02-20 17:43:42 UTC] mustyfunseeker: what game is this, it looks so rad!
[2019-02-20 17:43:50 UTC] ferokz: This is Anthem

[2019-02-20 17:45:55 UTC] belezibub: I think a cool mission would involve a timed flying trial that ended with maybe a boss or something to change things up a bit. Flying is the best part of the game so focusing on that would improve the missions
[2019-02-20 17:45:58 UTC] instant_savage: no bad luck protection inj this game

[2019-02-20 17:46:08 UTC] darealist83: I mean a game cant even get a couple weeks nowadays before people complain about what it dosent have or what they want in it ect...
[2019-02-20 17:46:19 UTC] meakis: because there isn't random crit chance
[2019-02-20 17:46:26 UTC] miniturecandy: seems like luck might be like crit chance
[2019-02-20 17:46:42 UTC] meakis: is there sound deformation for anthem for anybody ?

[2019-02-20 17:46:51 UTC] zamereon: From what I've read, gives you a better chance of upgrades, up to epic. So a better chance of common upgrading to uncommon, and uncommon upgrading to epic. Doesn't affect masterwork or legendaries though

[2019-02-20 17:47:36 UTC] meakis: No @MahaKali
[2019-02-20 17:47:36 UTC] belezibub: The problem with saying oh the game is good enough or oh stop being negative is that the games core is great but its missing a lot of stuff that expands on that core concept
[2019-02-20 17:47:36 UTC] zetseun: you want the full patchnotes @Towelliee ?
[2019-02-20 17:47:46 UTC] sidiuseqoa: does the $5 sub on origin enable play for a month on this game or does it take the $15 sub?

[2019-02-20 17:48:23 UTC] belezibub: @Pokanar Because its sold at the price tag of a full game so you judge it that way?

[2019-02-20 17:49:16 UTC] shinyoshiro: Cuz apex is free. WHich i dont think it makes MTs a good thing. but yeah.
[2019-02-20 17:49:19 UTC] pokanar: we spawned after first chest
[2019-02-20 17:49:21 UTC] mister_death: the thing is apex is f2p so people dont mind microtransactions
[2019-02-20 17:49:22 UTC] harvtv: ya gaming community has a weird double standard
[2019-02-20 17:49:22 UTC] shiroco: apex is free and the loot is just cosmetics

[2019-02-20 17:49:25 UTC] spyrhdwnas: Ye the main reason its ok for apex is because its free. Personally idc about lootboxes i just dont buy them anyway but they have a point.

[2019-02-20 17:51:34 UTC] darealist83: @belezibub fair enough but with that point why didnt the divison learn from Destiny and why didnt destiny learn from warframe ect...

[2019-02-20 17:57:43 UTC] belezibub: @DaRealist83 I know but I was hoping for just a little bit more maybe an armor for completing the main story. Just to show off they you had done it
[2019-02-20 17:57:47 UTC] sidiuseqoa: people more prone to it, like if it's in a lot of the family, drinking alot of alcohol could make it easier for them to get diabetes too i think just like eating alot of processed sugar which is in just about everything except for fruits and other natural foods
[2019-02-20 17:58:14 UTC] belezibub: Im type 1 diabetic got it when I was 7, none of the doctors really know why I got it

[2019-02-20 17:58:34 UTC] sidiuseqoa: type1 I think is the one you're born with, the one people as a child who had diabetes usually have
[2019-02-20 17:58:38 UTC] darealist83: oh i completly agree i was just puttingit ou there as to why we dont get armor pieces yet
[2019-02-20 17:58:40 UTC] shinyoshiro: I just eat meat and veggies mostly :)

[2019-02-20 17:59:10 UTC] belezibub: @SidiusEQOA Wasnt born with it and no history of family with it. So it was a mystery for my doctors. they had theories but no 100% reason

[2019-02-20 18:30:28 UTC] sidiuseqoa: @schnegsei what resolution? stutters often are from capping vram which shouldn't be a problem for your card or from capping out the cpu

[2019-02-20 18:33:22 UTC] sidiuseqoa: if you could possibly find a used cheap cpu that fits on the socket ony our board it might be a good way to boost frames abit moving to an i7 for hyperthreading
[2019-02-20 18:33:22 UTC] heikablade: @Towelliee your version is better

[2019-02-20 18:37:54 UTC] nevrask: @schnegsei same my pc is fairly new, hoping the day 1 patch fixes the issues ive been seeing from the community
[2019-02-20 18:38:01 UTC] orgrym: @aggelosk8884 that is a subjective question that will differ person to person. It has more end game content than other games of its genre at their launches but like any loot based game be it looter shooter or ARPG it is a grind at end game.
[2019-02-20 18:38:29 UTC] sidiuseqoa: razer does what gamebar was supposed to do by focusing on the game process, but also lets you disable some not needed background processes too
[2019-02-20 18:38:31 UTC] xyr3s: for me, i don't care if i have to run it on all low on 720 , i will if it's a game i want to play and if that will give me atleast 30 fps consistent lol
[2019-02-20 18:38:39 UTC] darealist83: that will be well over a 100 hours in this game that lacks content Kappa
[2019-02-20 18:38:44 UTC] schnegsei: I hope so to that the patch fixes the problems. I dont mind not playing on ultra. I just wanna play the game smoothly

[2019-02-20 18:39:25 UTC] gettinsouls: @Towelliee Speaking of lunch, I just made a spaghetti sauce out of a soup I made yesterday :D
[2019-02-20 18:39:26 UTC] murdabizness: @Towelliee how goes the end game didnt want to ruin story so havent been watching playthrough
[2019-02-20 18:39:36 UTC] sidiuseqoa: oh I meant @schnegsei lol
[2019-02-20 18:39:38 UTC] schnegsei: Between 60-100
[2019-02-20 18:39:42 UTC] harvtv: @Towelliee so thats what messed you up the other morning, windows game mode?
[2019-02-20 18:39:59 UTC] sidiuseqoa: @schnegsei use rtss and limit the fps to 60 and see if the stutters lessen
[2019-02-20 18:40:14 UTC] oceanpal: Can Legs and MW drop on normal Towl?
[2019-02-20 18:40:19 UTC] dingpong22: hopefully load times get longer Kappa
[2019-02-20 18:40:20 UTC] malazaa: get a ssd
[2019-02-20 18:40:24 UTC] xyr3s: load times are probably the biggest problem in the game
[2019-02-20 18:40:27 UTC] orgrym: @Oceanpal Dev
[2019-02-20 18:40:33 UTC] schnegsei: I dont know what rtss is 😄
[2019-02-20 18:40:34 UTC] murdabizness: @Towelliee hes 1 piece off masterwork its a component
[2019-02-20 18:40:46 UTC] sidiuseqoa: @schnegsei I did that to limit fps to 45 with rays on metro on the high/high, then limited to 30 to use extreme/high later on to keep from spikes causing stutters for me
[2019-02-20 18:40:54 UTC] shamwise: ssd is only part of the load issue for some sadly

[2019-02-20 18:41:09 UTC] orgrym: @Oceanpal Devs have been clear on it. only 6 MW weapons drop on hard or below. GM1 and above can drop all MWs. Far as legendaries who knows.
[2019-02-20 18:41:29 UTC] schnegsei: What is rtss?
[2019-02-20 18:41:37 UTC] oceanpal: @Orgrym Cool, thanks!!
[2019-02-20 18:41:42 UTC] sidiuseqoa: riva tuner statistics server
[2019-02-20 18:41:52 UTC] orgrym: @Merex760 Console load times are actually less than on PC. Plus one of the fixes advetisded for day 1 is shorter load times.
[2019-02-20 18:41:58 UTC] sidiuseqoa: it comes with msi afterburner packaged into it, but is also a separate download form places like guru3D
[2019-02-20 18:42:13 UTC] sidiuseqoa: I'd only trust guru3D or it's official forums ons ome other site
[2019-02-20 18:42:28 UTC] murdabizness: yea hoping the patch on friday does alot for loads
[2019-02-20 18:42:35 UTC] schnegsei: Ok will try that when im back on the pc

[2019-02-20 18:43:39 UTC] sidiuseqoa: in order to see the overlay you would need another tool like afterburner, or hwinfo, but rtss alone should still have the ffps limiter work and you could do a global, or set up a profile per .exe when a game has specific needs like using maybe 60fps in anthem and seeing how it goes for you

[2019-02-20 18:54:11 UTC] brolasco: if you dont find the gameplay enjoyable, fighting and flying. theres prob not much content for you cause everything outside of content is pretty lackluster

[2019-02-20 18:54:55 UTC] sidiuseqoa: I plan to give poe another try once it hits ps4 since I prefer using a controller for those style of games
[2019-02-20 18:55:09 UTC] insaynee: So it's 6 years old and still recycles its own content
[2019-02-20 18:55:09 UTC] hypadunk: @SidiusEQOA u wont enjoy it as much on console

[2019-02-20 19:11:57 UTC] orgrym: @armin1250 they haven't said they won't. However....their current design is to not require any one javelin for group content specifically. You make a healer they become required for high end content for the content to be balanced to be challenging. Each Javelin has a support ability and 2 offensive abilities. No reason to leave that formula

[2019-02-20 19:46:10 UTC] crossnf: raytracing always drops frames if compared

[2019-02-20 19:46:46 UTC] provision_: for those think rtx is useless watch metro difference with and without. it shows so much more details
[2019-02-20 19:46:52 UTC] crossnf: @chrism950 Fine yeah, but you don't get as big of fps
[2019-02-20 19:46:58 UTC] aethn: Old School Doom2 and Doom had lots of jump scare was fun
[2019-02-20 19:46:59 UTC] chrism950: benchmarks dont show ray tracing @Dapperedodo3
[2019-02-20 19:47:00 UTC] prince0fpain: @CrossNF it doesnt always drop its how you have your computer tweaked and whats running inthe background

[2019-02-20 19:48:35 UTC] crossnf: @Prince0fPain Why? I have an RTX card... and there are like hundreds of public benchmarks that show the difference
[2019-02-20 19:48:42 UTC] garenhoff: Why play with 30fps when you can play with 120fps
[2019-02-20 19:48:56 UTC] dapperedodo3: I love it more that people blindly trust everything a company says and dont do any research Kappa

[2019-02-20 19:49:17 UTC] chrism950: its legit what i do
[2019-02-20 19:49:20 UTC] provision_: @chrism950 i drop 30fps from 160 to 130 in Bf5 with rtx. so i don't see the issue while the game looks a lot better
[2019-02-20 19:49:24 UTC] tydeswow: i bet the next console they make will have 144 fps (ps5 and whatever xbox makes)
[2019-02-20 19:49:38 UTC] chrism950: OMG from 160 to 130 what ever will you do lmao
[2019-02-20 19:49:42 UTC] retrowalker: I think my PC is dying. I heard some weird noise coming from it just now
[2019-02-20 19:49:43 UTC] shmage: @Towelliee is the only end game right now the 3 strongholds?
[2019-02-20 19:49:45 UTC] chrism950: 130 fps is amazing
[2019-02-20 19:49:52 UTC] crossnf: @Provision_ Yeah you can still get good fps, people just tell lies that it doesn't affect fps at all
[2019-02-20 19:49:58 UTC] darealist83: because some people would rather spend 400 on a console rather then 3-6000 fot top of the line cpu
[2019-02-20 19:50:01 UTC] chrism950: ur right @Provision_
[2019-02-20 19:50:04 UTC] prince0fpain: @CrossNF benchmarks is one thing but i talking about my personal expierence. i played with my settings and my computer mine used to drop too now it stays steady expect whent he game sropps and not the card
[2019-02-20 19:50:05 UTC] grittytexan: Oh dude yeah the next gen consoles will basically be a pc it wouldn’t surprise me
[2019-02-20 19:50:15 UTC] chrism950: i just wish others could see and not blindly trust a youtube review they saw
[2019-02-20 19:50:16 UTC] tydeswow: anything above your refresh rate of your monitor is just DRing. like 200 fps isnt gonna look good on a 144hz monitor
[2019-02-20 19:50:33 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee that is said best lol

[2019-02-20 20:24:25 UTC] azmonde: mg its so bullet spongey because of the elementalists spam shield it will be fixed friday
[2019-02-20 20:25:03 UTC] skweakz: tomorrow or Friday ?
[2019-02-20 20:25:11 UTC] ozelsound: Friday
[2019-02-20 20:25:20 UTC] skweakz: dam got my hopes up :(
[2019-02-20 20:25:26 UTC] crossnf: @Azmonde They also reduce all shield amounts in general accross the board
[2019-02-20 20:25:28 UTC] ozelsound: Heard it was bad
[2019-02-20 20:25:30 UTC] darealist83: tomorrow at midnight
[2019-02-20 20:25:37 UTC] sollice: Is there a big skill leap from Hard to GM1?
[2019-02-20 20:25:45 UTC] sollice: Just hit 30, but I am 370
[2019-02-20 20:25:46 UTC] darealist83: yes
[2019-02-20 20:25:47 UTC] cross_contour: Friday is going to be a mess, thats when the general public gets the game
[2019-02-20 20:26:16 UTC] crossnf: @Sollice It's quite a big leap and you wanna be around 390-400 for GM1
[2019-02-20 20:26:27 UTC] sollice: Ok ty

[2019-02-20 20:26:30 UTC] skweakz: i feel like drops are based off ur GS not difficulty
[2019-02-20 20:26:35 UTC] crossnf: @Sollice I mean the strongholds even at 400+ will be super hard
[2019-02-20 20:26:55 UTC] sick_ak47jl_lmb: i heard stacking luck stat gives better quality loot
[2019-02-20 20:27:00 UTC] fistnthepank: i would say the most annoying this is the sound bug
[2019-02-20 20:27:00 UTC] azmonde: and luck?
[2019-02-20 20:27:07 UTC] darealist83: luck does help
[2019-02-20 20:27:09 UTC] deftoner500: So this early access does it carry over when full release comes out soon? Or is this like a beta?
[2019-02-20 20:27:10 UTC] sollice: Ill just stick with hard for a while and grind out some gear
[2019-02-20 20:27:11 UTC] stormy_fanta: @sKweakZ I think it's probably a mix of both
[2019-02-20 20:27:21 UTC] biscuitness: i wonder what the numbers breakdown is between early access and 'official' release on PC specifically. Feel like it's at least split, if not more during EA
[2019-02-20 20:27:26 UTC] skweakz: ya the game dosnt rly say...i wish they add more tool tips
[2019-02-20 20:27:28 UTC] crossnf: I've read on reddit the luck stat doesn't affect masterwork and legendary item drops @Towelliee

[2019-02-20 20:27:55 UTC] 5waze: High luck gives you better chance of Masterworks and Legendaries. Doesn't effect the percentage of loot dropped
