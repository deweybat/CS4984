[2019-02-24 00:00:03 UTC] mett7: time for exel math Kappa
[2019-02-24 00:00:05 UTC] thefamilydogs: If you do all the side quests while you progress in the story it takes 15-20 hours ish
[2019-02-24 00:00:09 UTC] callmeclutch40: Is this a game you see yourself playing longterm?
[2019-02-24 00:00:12 UTC] dragonofwolves: I though Bioware said something about content for Anthem being free
[2019-02-24 00:00:13 UTC] ghostlancer: @Towelliee whats that transition addon that Lulaboo uses?
[2019-02-24 00:00:28 UTC] ka5h3d: I mean it's cool if you wanna hate on the game, that's your choice, but don't lie about working on the game as some kind of justification for your opinion @Notoriuus
[2019-02-24 00:00:28 UTC] losthero420: im down losthero666
[2019-02-24 00:00:36 UTC] at1c: The upcoming content for this is free
[2019-02-24 00:00:36 UTC] noobishkamper: I did all side quests and watched every scene took 17 hours
[2019-02-24 00:00:50 UTC] seantorious: @At1c actually, they know their reputation when it comes to telling story. Why do you think they made that video "My Story, Our World" or whatever it's called. Because this was their way to not compromise story in a looter shooter which is known as a big problem in these games. So they they did say that it was going to be a BioWare story game and that's false, it's not. So yes, they basically were trying to make a story on par with Mass Effect and Dragon Age.
[2019-02-24 00:00:56 UTC] noobishkamper: Yes you need the 4 tombs
[2019-02-24 00:00:57 UTC] ka5h3d: It's free in entirety if you bought the game
[2019-02-24 00:01:05 UTC] wesley1213: @Towelliee Yes sir you can not move forward i did all the side stuff and was stuck until i finished the prereqs
[2019-02-24 00:01:06 UTC] ghostlancer: I'm entitled to free stuff :D
[2019-02-24 00:01:07 UTC] ka5h3d: Don't need premier for it
[2019-02-24 00:01:12 UTC] noobishkamper: But your progress counts if you don’t start it
[2019-02-24 00:01:13 UTC] tubbarz: the tomb quest was not nearly as bad as people were saying it was. just dont do all the side quests until you get to that point.
[2019-02-24 00:01:25 UTC] rinehar7: @towelliee all Anthem content is free no matter how you bought the title
[2019-02-24 00:01:27 UTC] gnral: letter from obama
[2019-02-24 00:01:30 UTC] noobishkamper: All dlc is free
[2019-02-24 00:01:32 UTC] tubbarz: do them at the same time and they still count to it
[2019-02-24 00:01:34 UTC] tazmad88: so you beat anthem already
[2019-02-24 00:01:40 UTC] esis1013: Have you killed the 4 named titans? I got a Lego off one on GM1
[2019-02-24 00:01:41 UTC] notoriuus: @Ka5h3d I did work on it. U don't have to believe me.

[2019-02-24 00:01:47 UTC] schluky: after BDO, no grind is tough enough
[2019-02-24 00:01:54 UTC] totikki: I actually had the attunement when I got there. I did freeplay
[2019-02-24 00:01:54 UTC] harvtv: they shifted the tombs quest at a earlier level

[2019-02-24 00:02:09 UTC] noobishkamper: You passively complete the tomb quests
[2019-02-24 00:02:18 UTC] kingkharmah: @Towelliee So whats endgame entail currently??
[2019-02-24 00:02:19 UTC] ka5h3d: @Notoriuus if you actually worked on it you'd be proud of your work and if anything you'd be promoting it, the fact you're here and salty about it basically says otherwise
[2019-02-24 00:02:23 UTC] tubbarz: I like this game because it feels like you actually have to grind and work for stuff, it's not just given to you.
[2019-02-24 00:02:23 UTC] 6pack12inch: bro watching u play anthem is so much more fun then wow
[2019-02-24 00:02:25 UTC] thefamilydogs: Standard edition gets all DLC, the next edition is cosmetic addons and discount.
[2019-02-24 00:02:25 UTC] spanky858: Hell, vanilla Molten Core, these kids though...
[2019-02-24 00:02:27 UTC] lt_dan_and_his_magic_legs: @Towelliee Our guild sold Champion of the Naaru achievement/attunement for heroic mechanaar.
[2019-02-24 00:02:30 UTC] littlemanmichael: The problem is everyone wants stuff without work. It's a damn shame these days
[2019-02-24 00:02:31 UTC] yungorcmane: Owen is bae
[2019-02-24 00:02:33 UTC] at1c: @Seantorious ech to there own, I still think it is good. While Bioware has dome some amazing stories. This stands up. While I would like more for what we have seen. It is good
[2019-02-24 00:02:33 UTC] tbmj_blaze: Just didnt make sense for the attunment to be in the middle of the game and slow the pace down of the story
[2019-02-24 00:02:34 UTC] stjosephsmith: I was a Molten Core raider. Get me that good loot.
[2019-02-24 00:02:36 UTC] killorders: @Schluky by BDO you mean AFK Fishing Online?
[2019-02-24 00:02:36 UTC] ifritswrath: i don't understand why people complain about this game having no content, but they will endlessly grind wow or destiny and do the same shit over and over again
[2019-02-24 00:02:37 UTC] galway21: Flamethrower bra!
[2019-02-24 00:02:49 UTC] pugup01: sniper
[2019-02-24 00:03:11 UTC] notoriuus: @Ka5h3d They fired me for a really silly reason. Thats why I am badmouthing it. I put like 1k hours in models for this game.
[2019-02-24 00:03:20 UTC] krayzeetoucan: rip shoes
[2019-02-24 00:03:28 UTC] hedrins: fired and now he is salty rooKek
[2019-02-24 00:03:29 UTC] ka5h3d: @Notoriuus so you're not badmouthing it because it's bad, but because you got fired and are salty about that?
[2019-02-24 00:03:30 UTC] schluky: @KillOrders uf u were into that sure, i only put afk fishing on when i wasnt playing
[2019-02-24 00:03:31 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @notoriuus but yet you can’t tell anyone what site or what you did for EA so no one believes you
[2019-02-24 00:03:32 UTC] 6pack12inch: ifrits both those games have some form of pvp or other content, you are limited to 3 here
[2019-02-24 00:03:34 UTC] mrgattz: can you pass leader in this game?
[2019-02-24 00:03:35 UTC] loganpauler18: towelliee is gay
[2019-02-24 00:03:40 UTC] psyphinit: What’s a good power level for doing g1 and g2?

[2019-02-24 00:03:53 UTC] psyphinit: Im at like 350 ish
[2019-02-24 00:03:59 UTC] ka5h3d: @Notoriuus frankly I see it one of two ways, either you're lying and using it as some kind of excuse to badmouth the game, or you're badmouthing it because you're mad they fired you
[2019-02-24 00:03:59 UTC] notoriuus: @gutterkhaoz U dont have to believe me as I said before.
[2019-02-24 00:04:04 UTC] tbmj_blaze: imagine how shitty the game would be if they didnt fire you
[2019-02-24 00:04:05 UTC] ifritswrath: @Notoriuus why even say anything at all then
[2019-02-24 00:04:18 UTC] killorders: @Schluky yeah, i think i would grind for like a hour or two then afk fish or path with a cart for the other 22 hours
[2019-02-24 00:04:23 UTC] lordchameleon: Bad Oni Bad!
[2019-02-24 00:04:28 UTC] tubbarz: damn @tbmj_blaze
[2019-02-24 00:04:29 UTC] brisingr1512: so should I ignore reviews and buy this game?
[2019-02-24 00:04:34 UTC] littlemanmichael: @Notoriuus It's a damn shame you think it's okay to badmouth something that's good because you lost your job for "a silly reason"
[2019-02-24 00:04:35 UTC] stjosephsmith: tbmj lmao
[2019-02-24 00:04:36 UTC] seantorious: @At1c knowing that it's a looter shooter, I know more story is going to be told. The "lack" of story isn't the issue, it's how they told it and the lack of quality of the story. Yeah, to each their own but this isn't what BioWare is known for. But the story isn't the only issue, the gameplay, to me, just got really boring really quickly. I'm just upset about it and I followed this game for years.
[2019-02-24 00:04:48 UTC] mrgattz: ignore reviews, but look at streams and decide if it looks like fun to you.
[2019-02-24 00:05:00 UTC] lordchameleon: Brisingr1512 I'd pay the $15 for origin access, you should be able to figure if you like it within a month
[2019-02-24 00:05:05 UTC] esis1013: Im glad this doesn't have pvp, it means they wont have to try to balance stuff out, I cant tell you how many games that have screwed over pve to fix pvp
[2019-02-24 00:05:08 UTC] red_n_gold21: @Brisingr1512 If your one the fence go get the $5 a month ea access. You get a 10 hour trial
[2019-02-24 00:05:10 UTC] tubbarz: try it on origin access if you have a comp that can play it
[2019-02-24 00:05:13 UTC] ka5h3d: I mean if you have legitimate gripes with the game and genuinely think it's bad then more power to you, you're entitled to your opinion, but if you're just salty because you got fired that's not a good reason to badmouth a product
[2019-02-24 00:05:16 UTC] ifritswrath: no one ever claimed this was going to be an "mmo mass effect" if you are disappointed in the story, you only have yourself to blame
[2019-02-24 00:05:19 UTC] fistnthepank: can i come?
[2019-02-24 00:05:21 UTC] ka5h3d: In fact it's a good reason not to hire you in the future
[2019-02-24 00:05:23 UTC] at1c: @Notoriuus It's not easy get fired for a company at that size, so you clearly broke the contract you had with them really bad.
[2019-02-24 00:05:28 UTC] mrgattz: @fistnthepank sure whats your origin name
[2019-02-24 00:05:30 UTC] temezix: @Towelliee you guys prefer grinding tyrant mine over temple of scar?
[2019-02-24 00:05:32 UTC] brisingr1512: thanks guys

[2019-02-24 00:05:36 UTC] slapnuaround: Game is fun as hell so far worth the 15 pre for sure /after that well lets see the patches
[2019-02-24 00:05:39 UTC] mett7: GM3 today ?? Kappa
[2019-02-24 00:05:42 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @notoriuus whether they fired you for silly reasons or valid reasons that doesn’t mean you should come badmouth a game that you supposedly worked on.
[2019-02-24 00:05:45 UTC] ka5h3d: Imagine hiring someone in the video game industry who badmouths a product they worked on because they got fired
[2019-02-24 00:05:48 UTC] thefamilydogs: @Notoriuus why did you get fired from EA?

[2019-02-24 00:06:40 UTC] elaphros: @IfritsWrath nah man, the story should have been longer, I know it's got updates coming, but for $60 up front it should be a full game, it really wasn't. If I wasn't using Origin access I'd be pissed, even though I like playing the game.
[2019-02-24 00:06:40 UTC] christhereaper13: you charge your shoes to tie themselves

[2019-02-24 00:07:39 UTC] ifritswrath: how is it not a full game though? anthem was marketed as a looter shooter, not an in depth single player experience

[2019-02-24 00:09:05 UTC] tubbarz: multiplayer games should not have 40 hour stories. That's why they have end game.
[2019-02-24 00:09:07 UTC] ka5h3d: Honestly if the story is about 25 hours that's more than double the length of D2's story

[2019-02-24 00:36:21 UTC] sketchsquadttv: looking for that right spec but the game engine seems to want you to teach you to be well rounded with multiple guns
[2019-02-24 00:36:22 UTC] utv_: there should be an icon like Javeline so it would aply an all your skills
[2019-02-24 00:36:25 UTC] ilootnshoot: This game needs a character sheet
[2019-02-24 00:36:26 UTC] deice: blast damage only applies to this gear. which does no blast dmg.

[2019-02-24 00:36:42 UTC] mett7: for blast
[2019-02-24 00:36:42 UTC] dylon24: @SketchSquadTTV google would prob be more helpful, but its basically to help people affected by poverty or emergency situations

[2019-02-24 00:39:58 UTC] n8urso: @RoflPidgey no prob. det strike is insane does AOE damage and primes. cryo and venom bomb are both good just depends on ur preference. I like cryo. goodluck!
[2019-02-24 00:40:01 UTC] schluky: @Firepong9877 check your buff to hover on gunslinger
[2019-02-24 00:40:06 UTC] sketchsquadttv: @towelliee if you want a certain spec youre basically tryingn to get that luck roll... the engine feels like the rolls are out of luck.. does it ever pertain to your spec?
[2019-02-24 00:40:14 UTC] grimmel95: @Towelliee I was able to fix audio without having to restart Anthem by doing the following: Alt tab out to windows -- I went into sound settings --> device properties --> Enhancements and then checked the box for "Disable all enhancements" and then clicked apply worked for me it also might have been me switching from headset to speakers and back to headset in the sound settings also...but all I know is I didn't have to restart the game
[2019-02-24 00:40:16 UTC] sketchsquadttv: 7 leggos bro
[2019-02-24 00:40:19 UTC] colouhm: Ohhhh cuteness
[2019-02-24 00:40:22 UTC] excuselol89: @Towelliee sound via control panel --> your soundouput --> enhanced and there is a dropdwon put it on 24 bit and 44100 hz --- there is also a reddit post about that
[2019-02-24 00:40:23 UTC] dylon24: @SketchSquadTTV yea what twitch did was during a 2 week period they matched a % of all bit donations and donated it to the charity, and people got this badge
[2019-02-24 00:40:23 UTC] roflpidgey: @n8urso I did get the MW spark dash that resets on kill, but the wind up just murders me
[2019-02-24 00:40:31 UTC] sketchsquadttv: disable enhancements that wa an otion for some games
[2019-02-24 00:40:54 UTC] deice: to fix sound issue, have to alt-F4
[2019-02-24 00:40:55 UTC] zeethiandragon: Kreygasm
[2019-02-24 00:40:56 UTC] grimmel95: @Towelliee try the device properties first
[2019-02-24 00:41:00 UTC] n8urso: @RoflPidgey yeah spark dash is actually fixed and works at least but the animation time on higher difficulties is too killer. go with cryo or venom bomb for sure
[2019-02-24 00:41:01 UTC] mett7: i also got this bug everyday
[2019-02-24 00:41:09 UTC] grimmel95: @Towelliee worked for me and havent lost audio since
[2019-02-24 00:41:12 UTC] dublive: You have to just restart game bro
[2019-02-24 00:41:13 UTC] schluky: @Firepong9877 there was an exploit, where if u dashed in air, u applied gunslinger buff again, and again , and again, making storms do insane dmg. now the buff reads 0%, emergency patched i guess
[2019-02-24 00:41:19 UTC] dublive: Seriously just restart
[2019-02-24 00:41:21 UTC] n8urso: @RoflPidgey you don't need a detonator ability anyway because your melee and ultimate detonate so better to use 2 primers on interceptor
[2019-02-24 00:41:38 UTC] dublive: It happened to me earlier
[2019-02-24 00:41:41 UTC] roflpidgey: @n8urso ahh, makes sense, thanks bud :D
[2019-02-24 00:41:46 UTC] firepong9877: @Schluky So now Gunslinger does nothing?
[2019-02-24 00:41:50 UTC] n8urso: @RoflPidgey anytime good luck bro

[2019-02-24 01:33:15 UTC] the_enygma: modern gaming, ya'll!
[2019-02-24 01:33:18 UTC] feedonweed: Yeah the armour sets are cool As fu
[2019-02-24 01:33:20 UTC] thead_enco: agree
[2019-02-24 01:33:24 UTC] foulbeast: It's working as intended.
[2019-02-24 01:33:26 UTC] kappamerc: Freeze still doesn't help you beat gm3 lol
[2019-02-24 01:33:29 UTC] n8urso: @N2alive yeah you also get a legendary weapon to start out with. its low level but will be relevant for your first week or so at least
[2019-02-24 01:33:32 UTC] stunnersir: wait when you are in GM3 you wont think its so OP
[2019-02-24 01:33:32 UTC] zardon3001: looks like it lasts way too long
[2019-02-24 01:33:37 UTC] rocketmunkey: it's the great equalizer at GM2/GM3
[2019-02-24 01:33:45 UTC] kexanr: freeze effects are always the first thing to get nerfed in new games
[2019-02-24 01:33:54 UTC] kappamerc: only in games with pvp
[2019-02-24 01:33:56 UTC] how3lldaddy: Yeah it's the same in poe... freezing monsters is such a strong defense
[2019-02-24 01:34:01 UTC] reload3099: How's the game so far? still debating
[2019-02-24 01:34:21 UTC] itsrichc91: thiccboi smash OhMyDog
[2019-02-24 01:34:24 UTC] kappamerc: I honestly hope they just keep scaling it all up, no nerfs, just mobs to counter.
[2019-02-24 01:34:25 UTC] n8urso: @reload3099 most people seem to be enjoying it as am i
[2019-02-24 01:34:41 UTC] reload3099: seems fun just repetitive
[2019-02-24 01:35:13 UTC] zardon3001: reload3099 yeah, that seems to be the thing with looter shooters.
[2019-02-24 01:35:14 UTC] n8urso: @reload3099 the gameplay loop is really fun though. all games in this genre are repetitive. they are going to keep adding content
[2019-02-24 01:35:36 UTC] harvtv: most looters are @reload3099
[2019-02-24 01:35:50 UTC] reload3099: Yeah, fair point
[2019-02-24 01:35:57 UTC] foulbeast: @reload3099 That's basically every game to date, almost.

[2019-02-24 01:36:26 UTC] reload3099: Did anything ever surface about pvp? i remember people losing their minds about no pvp
[2019-02-24 01:36:43 UTC] zardon3001: nah there won't be pvp.
[2019-02-24 01:36:56 UTC] harvtv: those ppl have apex nbd
[2019-02-24 01:37:01 UTC] n8urso: @reload3099 most people who actually got the game don't want it. itll take away from content and cause them to nerf and balance everything into oblivion. they didn't completely rule it out though in the future
[2019-02-24 01:37:08 UTC] zardon3001: crazy people acted crazy bout no pvp, the destiny pvp sucked and it probably would in this too
[2019-02-24 01:37:10 UTC] reload3099: Yeah exactly
[2019-02-24 01:37:15 UTC] testotroll: do the strongholds have fixed loot.. when i grind GM1 tyrant mine it seems like its always the same stuff that drops

[2019-02-24 01:37:24 UTC] the_enygma: its like asking your parents to go to the mall and they say "we'll see"
[2019-02-24 01:37:26 UTC] rocketg: they could have a pvp mode like destiny's gambit, that would be lit
[2019-02-24 01:37:29 UTC] the_enygma: it's code for no
[2019-02-24 01:37:29 UTC] rocketmunkey: or some post-launch "arena" dlc/expansion
[2019-02-24 01:37:37 UTC] kappamerc: destiny pvp is anything but lit
[2019-02-24 01:37:40 UTC] rocketmunkey: "proving grounds" type thing

[2019-02-24 01:37:56 UTC] foulbeast: I'm perfectly fine with no pvp, not every game needs it.
[2019-02-24 01:37:57 UTC] zardon3001: Kappamerc yeah it wasn't that good imo
[2019-02-24 01:38:12 UTC] rocketg: @kappamerc gambit is
[2019-02-24 01:38:15 UTC] feedonweed: I just want a PVE focused game, no pvp to take the focus off the grind
[2019-02-24 01:38:22 UTC] nadpu: cuz warframe pvp is doodoo
[2019-02-24 01:38:23 UTC] anchovey13: okay everyone pvps in destiny. thats not accurate
[2019-02-24 01:38:25 UTC] k00nfuez: yeah the pvp mode in warframe is not that great
[2019-02-24 01:38:30 UTC] rocketg: they should make something like gambit
[2019-02-24 01:38:32 UTC] mrgattz: yeah pvp is a waste of time
[2019-02-24 01:38:37 UTC] epiclurker27893: How would PvP in Anthem work? Far too much movement with very little aim assist.
[2019-02-24 01:38:41 UTC] mrgattz: dont spend the resources on pvp when it could be a new raid
[2019-02-24 01:38:44 UTC] killorders: honestly i think anyone playing a shooter looter isn't playing it for pvp. thats what fps are for. honestly i hate when pvpers bitch and get rpgs broken just to make pvp work
[2019-02-24 01:38:45 UTC] supahman15: towelie im playing a ranger, should i go with freezing grenade for combos or frag grenade that adds +700% to ULT build
[2019-02-24 01:38:46 UTC] civtac: pvp in destiny is hugely popular
[2019-02-24 01:38:47 UTC] harvtv: people wanted pvp in wildlands and after they added it no one played it
[2019-02-24 01:38:50 UTC] n8urso: warframes pvp is utter trash. that's because they didn't nerf and balance stuff for it so people stay away from it. if they did balance things the game would be ruined
[2019-02-24 01:38:51 UTC] eboudar: Division got PvP right
[2019-02-24 01:39:00 UTC] decoythatguy: @Towelliee PvP in Warframe is crap. its way unbalanced. if you dont have the mods, you die fast. and they can even 1 shot anymore.
[2019-02-24 01:39:08 UTC] kislota_: @towelliee last patch decrased masterworks loot a lot!
[2019-02-24 01:39:11 UTC] frankisdrunk: I think most casual gamers do both

[2019-02-24 01:39:19 UTC] strykerzerov2: @Civtac lmfaooo no its not
[2019-02-24 01:39:24 UTC] reload3099: Itd be cool if there was some kind of competitive mode, liek 4v4 objective based gameplay
[2019-02-24 01:39:26 UTC] drago5614: i dont think this game is really designed for pvp, theres alot to manage and balance for a pvp environment especially when every item has rng bonus stats that can be super op or really terrible xD
[2019-02-24 01:39:27 UTC] rocketg: They could have a pvp mode like gambit
[2019-02-24 01:39:31 UTC] madkoister: PvP in these RPG like games with levels and gear just never really works because they need to balance it for pvp which tends to mess up pve
[2019-02-24 01:39:34 UTC] steamro11r: ihope they dont do pvp they will try to balance it and ruin pve
[2019-02-24 01:39:35 UTC] narakusoul: !Bonus Stacking

[2019-02-24 01:40:21 UTC] spiderbyt3s: @Towelliee what would you think about PVP with bonus effects on items turned off?
[2019-02-24 01:40:26 UTC] strykerzerov2: @reload3099 absolutely not
[2019-02-24 01:40:28 UTC] n8urso: id rather have the resources of a potential pvp in Anthem go to creating new storylines/ content/ gear
[2019-02-24 01:40:39 UTC] n8urso: all day

[2019-02-24 01:40:52 UTC] testotroll: hey, do strongholds have fixed loot.. seems like i always get more or less the same when i grind GM1 tyr+
[2019-02-24 01:41:00 UTC] nadpu: PvP in anthem would take a ton of instanced balancing and gutting to make it work.. so much that it'd practically be a new game. @Towelliee
[2019-02-24 01:41:03 UTC] coltz_v2: They need to keep this game a looter shooter
[2019-02-24 01:41:11 UTC] n8urso: ^^^
[2019-02-24 01:41:12 UTC] solipsist: lol, your colossus went from being the purple ranger to the red hulk.
[2019-02-24 01:41:44 UTC] killorders: i hate when devs cave in games to pvpers when its like 2% of the population that bitches the loudest, then the balance for pve gets fucked up
[2019-02-24 01:41:59 UTC] funkshun: @testotroll yes, strongholds above gm1 have guaranteed masterwork at the end boss, and it is always a skill
[2019-02-24 01:42:02 UTC] rocketg: im just saying a gambit in anthem would be lit... like a better more strategy/teamwork based version of gambit from destiny
[2019-02-24 01:42:07 UTC] chiraakitteh: No, loot is from a pool, not fixed loot doer dungeon... before gm, there is only a pool of 6 ME items, tho, need to move to gm difficukties to have the bigger pool
[2019-02-24 01:42:24 UTC] funkshun: @testotroll leg contracts are the same but you receive components instead of skills
[2019-02-24 01:42:32 UTC] reload3099: @Towelliee What about 4v4 objective based PvE, take out the PvP aspect but add a competitive edge for loot?
[2019-02-24 01:42:41 UTC] n8urso: @RocketG a gambit (even if it didnt have the actual invasion part) would probably be sick
[2019-02-24 01:42:42 UTC] lordchameleon: RTX ON!
[2019-02-24 01:42:56 UTC] harvtv: i think its fixed on hard but anything above hard have access to all masterowkrs
[2019-02-24 01:43:01 UTC] funkshun: they could do a gambit style mode
[2019-02-24 01:43:08 UTC] audiononsense: Towelliee totally agree

[2019-02-24 02:24:16 UTC] royduran: nope
[2019-02-24 02:24:36 UTC] aethn: Anthem is nothing like Destiny 2, its actually a SciFi version of Diablo 3 if you want to compare
[2019-02-24 02:24:43 UTC] the_real_vanilla: But @Towelliee , anthem and destiny are in the same genre of games, that means its the same game pepega
[2019-02-24 02:25:03 UTC] h2co: harvest bonus does apply on chests, yes
[2019-02-24 02:25:04 UTC] zadwanaa: I dunno about that... i melee with the interceptor

[2019-02-24 02:25:18 UTC] stronghandwilly: @The_Real_Vanilla that's like saying people don't compare the same type of food such as burgers...
[2019-02-24 02:25:25 UTC] superbrotendo: Yeah Tekken 7 is basically just Street Fighter 5 2.0 hhurrr
[2019-02-24 02:25:28 UTC] sketchsquadttv: vid drivers bro i swear
[2019-02-24 02:25:30 UTC] stronghandwilly: @The_Real_Vanilla comparing is somethign people do in life ....
[2019-02-24 02:25:31 UTC] royduran: from what i read, the devs said it happens when 4 players are near each other and somethign triggers the bug
[2019-02-24 02:25:33 UTC] sneiper83: @SuperBrotendo i see you obviously got offended.. i majorly apologize... i really didn't intend to affect your tender feelings... however.. i wasn't joking at all.. it was a legit question.. i think this game is very similar to destiny 2
[2019-02-24 02:25:39 UTC] horuce: what was the update that was for anthem cause mine just updated
[2019-02-24 02:25:40 UTC] broomba: comparing games is like 2000

[2019-02-24 02:25:50 UTC] camarac: loot is trash today what happened
[2019-02-24 02:25:52 UTC] og_fear: @Towelliee ahh I see if ur planning on running more dungeons lemme know
[2019-02-24 02:26:01 UTC] og_fear: ahh ok cool will run those for sure.
[2019-02-24 02:26:01 UTC] superbrotendo: @Sneiper83 you're not very bright are ya, bud?
[2019-02-24 02:26:08 UTC] sketchsquadttv: The only solution is to restart the game. You will then need to go to the settings menu and press "Exit Anthem." Here you will be shown on the Windows desktop, and then you can restart the game and finally have the audio.
[2019-02-24 02:26:13 UTC] mitch0782: ive got 2 legendary contracts
[2019-02-24 02:26:14 UTC] spiderbyt3s: how do you know if its a legendary contract, i am new here
[2019-02-24 02:26:23 UTC] stronghandwilly: @The_Real_Vanilla what he said was wrong yes, but this game needs to be compared to Destiny, Warframe, and Division
[2019-02-24 02:26:23 UTC] sketchsquadttv: BioWare has confirmed that it knows the sound cuts out issue exists and is planning a day one patch to help fix the problem.
[2019-02-24 02:26:24 UTC] sneiper83: @SuperBrotendo sure thing... :)

[2019-02-24 02:26:52 UTC] the_real_vanilla: @Stronghandwilly as I said, comparing is completely fine, but the games are not the same..
[2019-02-24 02:26:59 UTC] stronghandwilly: @The_Real_Vanilla these excuses like look at those games at launch didn't give this oen an excuse to be hollow on end game
[2019-02-24 02:27:00 UTC] bonedit: I have contracts @Towelliee

[2019-02-24 02:27:07 UTC] amdekorr: @Towelliee the sound bug is part of the game engine and not fixable, it was in starwars battlefront 2. it is usually triggered by weapons
[2019-02-24 02:27:10 UTC] flintkiller: what is he looking for?
[2019-02-24 02:27:15 UTC] dingpong22: in the tunnel

[2019-02-24 03:11:06 UTC] prey0491: If you look at the quest objective it will tell you if you need to kill them as well
[2019-02-24 03:11:15 UTC] angiergaming: there IS content. it's a looter shooter, regardless what amount of diverse content they add it will always end up being aimed at a grind.
[2019-02-24 03:11:33 UTC] sketchsquadttv: you need the gear level to be 50 and legendary
[2019-02-24 03:11:36 UTC] sketchsquadttv: 500 loots
[2019-02-24 03:11:41 UTC] strykerzerov2: @SuperBrotendo right

[2019-02-24 03:12:04 UTC] nixxaam: Can someone tell me what you do in Anthem? i'm interested in buying it but i don't even know what you do in it.
[2019-02-24 03:12:11 UTC] superbrotendo: @StrykerZeroV2 listen bud you're saying a lot of wrong stuff so let's end the conversation, yeah?
[2019-02-24 03:12:20 UTC] joshyv123: i really wish i had the extra money for this game. Damn adulting :(
[2019-02-24 03:12:43 UTC] angiergaming: @Nixxaam it's a looter shooter. just like destiny you want to up your gearscore by grinding out missions, dungeons and maybe "raids" sometime in the future.
[2019-02-24 03:12:47 UTC] strykerzerov2: @SuperBrotendo please correct me where Im wrong? nothing about destiny is hard, that's where the convo ends lol
[2019-02-24 03:13:04 UTC] bainegaming: yer i was just soloing a mission in GM2 just now and i was hardly taking damage with my thicboi
[2019-02-24 03:13:04 UTC] katiegaming: Well you both need to stop the conversation bc im getting annoyed now.

[2019-02-24 03:14:28 UTC] borathius: the enemy doesnt' scale like that. its based on the type of enemy and the quantity with that type
[2019-02-24 03:14:30 UTC] droolindrood: I mean I hope not but I am getting a bad Fallout 76 vibe here lol

[2019-02-24 03:17:40 UTC] katiegaming: Question is, Do you guys think This game is better than Destiny 2? from what we have played so far
[2019-02-24 03:17:43 UTC] n8urso: @droolindrood every single looter shooter in the history of looter shooters is repetitive.
[2019-02-24 03:17:44 UTC] borathius: you're guaranteed 2 masterworks from gm2

[2019-02-24 03:17:57 UTC] flyingsloppyjoe: The game is deeper then Destiny.
[2019-02-24 03:17:58 UTC] chickdrummer88: Can we just not compare it to other games and play it? teenIDK
[2019-02-24 03:18:00 UTC] gody233: to be honest toweliee, its okays that you like the game. You haven't played much AAA games besides mmos. But if you are that guy that plays a lot, you will realize there is a ton of problems with this game. Just my two cents. And I don't like how companies are doing this live service crap. It would be fine if the full game at launch wasn't missing so much stuff. But a lot of companies are doing this.
[2019-02-24 03:18:01 UTC] strykerzerov2: @Ovium56 nothing like destiny
[2019-02-24 03:18:10 UTC] mafia0330: what do you use to freeze them?

[2019-02-24 03:18:15 UTC] chickdrummer88: You can legit play it for $15 with the pass. Try it and see if you like it
[2019-02-24 03:18:16 UTC] superbrotendo: @KatieGaming maybe after a year of fixes and updates in could be, but I don't see a point in comparing them when you could enjoy both.
[2019-02-24 03:18:19 UTC] angiergaming: @KatieGaming the gameplay is miles ahead of destiny 2. way more fun and fluid. of course it's missing on some background mechanics D1/2 have down by now but that will come in time
[2019-02-24 03:18:25 UTC] zombiezlayer99: @
[2019-02-24 03:18:27 UTC] harvtv: the lore seems more intriguing then destiny thats for sure
[2019-02-24 03:18:32 UTC] theklownhero: So whats the secret to not getting dc'd every 5 mins?
[2019-02-24 03:18:34 UTC] n8urso: @Broomba im a fan of this game. hes saying the gameplay doesn't look like fun and will try it in 90 days. im saying the gameplay wont change
[2019-02-24 03:18:35 UTC] katiegaming: I dont enjoy both bc i dont play Destiny lol So i was curious :P

[2019-02-24 03:18:51 UTC] superbrotendo: But you COULD :p
[2019-02-24 03:18:56 UTC] sketchsquadttv: i wonder if an outboard uSb audio interface would help the sound @toweliee
[2019-02-24 03:18:57 UTC] katiegaming: And i saw i had it on Bnet....for free...soooo lol thats why i asked xD
[2019-02-24 03:18:58 UTC] broomba: @n8urso i know and backing u up just adding that the game will add more and new stuff in 90 days
[2019-02-24 03:19:00 UTC] poniiee: why can't I stop playing anthem? I need sleep :(
[2019-02-24 03:19:08 UTC] mafia0330: could you show what you use to freeze the enemy?

[2019-02-24 03:19:10 UTC] ovium56: @StrykerZeroV2 not trolling but a gamer so give me the feed back, i want to try it
[2019-02-24 03:19:23 UTC] michaelcsoul: without that 40$ dlc thing ur not getting the full game it seems lol
[2019-02-24 03:19:24 UTC] n8urso: @Broomba I just hope they keep rolling out more and more and not just slow roll after those 90 days

[2019-02-24 03:20:21 UTC] harvtv: @gody233 chances are tow has more hours in this game then you lol
[2019-02-24 03:20:25 UTC] katiegaming: More people should think like that @Towelliee You are exactly right.

[2019-02-24 03:20:30 UTC] angiergaming: @gody233 the thing is, the core gameplay experience is fun and solid. yes, it has flaws but nothing *by design*, which means it's just a matter of effort to fix em, not of rethinking how the game works.
[2019-02-24 03:20:35 UTC] chickdrummer88: @flyingsloppyjoe He isn't a HUGE hockey fan
[2019-02-24 03:20:41 UTC] whisporz: Anthem has a lot of stuff wrong for full release...feels like early access
[2019-02-24 03:20:43 UTC] michaelcsoul: do you think u could only enjoy the game if you hardcore it? @Towelliee or it be fun for like casual players as well?
[2019-02-24 03:20:43 UTC] iruntodrink: Some just like to bitch about EVERYTHING
[2019-02-24 03:20:43 UTC] ovium56: @StrykerZeroV2 been watching lol looks like Destiny in mechs to me
[2019-02-24 03:20:47 UTC] chickdrummer88: Although, Gritty flying into the stadium was awesome LUL
[2019-02-24 03:20:57 UTC] chickdrummer88: This game needs less loading screens #1
[2019-02-24 03:20:59 UTC] sketchsquadttv: thats awesome
[2019-02-24 03:21:04 UTC] strykerzerov2: @Ovium56 and its nothing like destiny
[2019-02-24 03:21:05 UTC] sketchsquadttv: the filters need to happen
[2019-02-24 03:21:06 UTC] flyingsloppyjoe: @Towelliee Pens vs Flyers. He sports a Golden Knights hat.
[2019-02-24 03:21:06 UTC] sketchsquadttv: its not hard
[2019-02-24 03:21:11 UTC] n8urso: @Ovium56 nothing like destiny
[2019-02-24 03:21:12 UTC] sketchsquadttv: its a smple java or sql querty
[2019-02-24 03:21:14 UTC] gody233: UI is a huge problem, mission design sucks, DC's, some balancing problems with guns being completely op as fuck, these are facts
[2019-02-24 03:21:16 UTC] sketchsquadttv: and ui design
[2019-02-24 03:21:22 UTC] angiergaming: roll logic and UI can be relatively easily fixed over having a wonky gameplay experience. but anthem's is solid, that's a good thing @Towelliee
[2019-02-24 03:21:24 UTC] chickdrummer88: @flyingsloppyjoe Yeah, but he's more into football and baseball than hockey
[2019-02-24 03:21:41 UTC] phantom_wulfstan: lol
[2019-02-24 03:21:45 UTC] gody233: The biggest problem is bioware using Frostbyte engine
[2019-02-24 03:21:50 UTC] superbrotendo: I enjoy playing this video game. "but Towelliee it doesn't even give you hand jobs while you play ooooo aaaaaa"

[2019-02-24 03:22:16 UTC] dhevoni: loot is the problem, rolling physical dmg that only applies to that item on my elemental skill is just wrong
[2019-02-24 03:22:20 UTC] phantom_wulfstan: that guy still going trying to change your mind about the game huh
[2019-02-24 03:22:25 UTC] broomba: @chickdrummer88 lol :P
[2019-02-24 03:22:36 UTC] elirank9: @Dhevoni they already said they changing it very soon
[2019-02-24 03:22:50 UTC] broomba: @Phantom_wulfstan -- its those people missions
[2019-02-24 03:22:52 UTC] katiegaming: No liking games on twitch. LUL
[2019-02-24 03:22:55 UTC] angiergaming: @Dhevoni agreed. but that's just a matter of refining roll logic. the game itself is fun, isnt' it?
[2019-02-24 03:22:58 UTC] uchihajesus: i like the game so far, im looking forward for more content
[2019-02-24 03:23:01 UTC] natees: anyone else feel wene you slide into the suit it feels like your going into a vagina XD
[2019-02-24 03:23:05 UTC] z3r0fear: its illegal to enjoy video games! totally illegal you cant enjoy them! LOL some of the stuff people say are funny as hell
[2019-02-24 03:23:07 UTC] gody233: This is how you fix the game. MAKE more monster missions! Huge monsters. We all like fighting them you know. Give us some bounties to hunt these monsters. This would be such a cool game if they took some of MHW elements out of it.
[2019-02-24 03:23:08 UTC] chickdrummer88: NO FUN FOR YOU
[2019-02-24 03:23:09 UTC] mafia0330: @Towelliee what are you using to freeze your enemy?

[2019-02-24 03:25:43 UTC] gody233: @HarvTV In real life conversations, you kinda do expect something you know. The game makes you feel nothing and your decisions in talking is pointless

[2019-02-24 03:29:04 UTC] angiergaming: the shooting part has been ever since just the animation of dealing damage. it never has been about twitch aim skills.

[2019-02-24 03:30:53 UTC] angiergaming: the risk/reward ratio in GM2/3 feels off. even with 490+ the time it takes to down an enemy compared to what you get is ridiculous. I have the feeling, tho, that will change with the coming new items that may ramp up both survivability and damage.

[2019-02-24 03:31:58 UTC] harvtv: lol
[2019-02-24 03:31:59 UTC] zombiezlayer99: Grandmaster shouldn’t just be health and damage increase. They need to reduce it and add more enemies, more spawns, smart ai. Things that don’t just artificially make difficulty
[2019-02-24 03:32:06 UTC] kevdeckie: his fire attack has no LOS on it
[2019-02-24 03:32:20 UTC] kevdeckie: you have to block it
[2019-02-24 03:32:36 UTC] angiergaming: @Top_Sum agreed. I stick to GM1 for the time being and just stack luck. most of my MW/legos are fine roll wise already. but as they already have announced new items in their 90 day plan I totally expect the gear level to ramp up with em
[2019-02-24 03:32:37 UTC] z3r0fear: @Kevdeckie or be high enough to avoid it
[2019-02-24 03:32:45 UTC] decoythatguy: @Towelliee he did 2 orb tings on you. one in front of you and then one behind you. you just did not dodge the back on, after you dodged the front one

[2019-02-24 03:33:17 UTC] michaelcsoul: i wonder if you can stun an titan
[2019-02-24 03:33:25 UTC] phantom_wulfstan: wow that burn dmg is dumb
[2019-02-24 03:33:35 UTC] major_warzone: you gota hit him hard enough in the open back to stun him
[2019-02-24 03:33:54 UTC] salsainyoureyes: What difficulty is he on
[2019-02-24 03:33:57 UTC] prey0491: You can outrange the fire walls, then if you have a bit of cover near you, you just steo behind it when the fireballs come out
[2019-02-24 03:34:07 UTC] proclicker: Towelliee's Mech has Judge Dredd colors
[2019-02-24 03:34:08 UTC] michaelcsoul: huh guess i never did that in the open demo
[2019-02-24 03:34:28 UTC] z3r0fear: Is his sound screwed up?
[2019-02-24 03:34:41 UTC] kafgark: @Z3r0Fear its game sound
[2019-02-24 03:34:58 UTC] zombiezlayer99: @z3r0fear Titans are fun, they have so much health and most of their body is immune or very resistant. Plus the games network coding sucks as you can get hit by a titan’s many attacks when you’re nowhere near it
[2019-02-24 03:35:05 UTC] michaelcsoul: lower ur hp gets the more it sounds kinda like dead i guess
[2019-02-24 03:35:05 UTC] z3r0fear: maybe just low health
[2019-02-24 03:35:06 UTC] zombiezlayer99: Aren’t*

[2019-02-24 04:03:16 UTC] pkpip: I'm not buying the game because instead of making content to keep playing playing past max level, they added 70000 difficulty settings to play the same content just a little harder each time

[2019-02-24 04:15:33 UTC] michaelcsoul: thats just.... whats the point of melee then LOL
[2019-02-24 04:15:37 UTC] marajohana: i think you need to kite the small ones to the boss when they spawn and kill all of them with a combo .. so the combo goes on the boss
[2019-02-24 04:15:37 UTC] razatiger23: easiest in 1000% scar temple

[2019-02-24 04:17:16 UTC] mastacombs: @dhevoni 4-6 a stronghold is not normal 1-3 is. I got 8 masterworks in 30 mins freeplay world events
[2019-02-24 04:17:52 UTC] n8urso: @michaelcsoul its a well rounded strong single target damage jav. you have to play it right. once you get the right gear and inscriptions and components its insane. takes time. one of those "hard to master jack of all trades" types that seems dull but really isnt
[2019-02-24 04:18:14 UTC] thecptdiabetes: there are ledges u can perch on on the sides and you dont get attacked while u attack the boss and other teanates fly around

[2019-02-24 04:38:52 UTC] n8urso: @Ozixxthegreat yeah its a lot of unwarranted hate out of EA spite. it def has some bugs and will be improved but the gameplay is really fun
[2019-02-24 04:39:02 UTC] ozixxthegreat: cool

[2019-02-24 04:39:30 UTC] jbmoongirl: This game won’t replace Destiny for me but it is super fun
[2019-02-24 04:39:36 UTC] tangiwii: I think EA could have waited another month to at least fix the more serious issues and people would have taken it alot better
[2019-02-24 04:39:46 UTC] tangiwii: but ya theres alot of people who are just like. EA?! reeeeeeee
[2019-02-24 04:39:50 UTC] deathsmojo: just taking a mini gun to the face lol
[2019-02-24 04:39:52 UTC] easyway723: @TgrShark69 if they dont revert the loot drop rate I would even waist my time with this game to be honest. I will probably quit playing after my first month of prime runs out. They ruined the game by taking the fun out of it.
[2019-02-24 04:40:06 UTC] tangiwii: they fixed the loot drop rate this morning
[2019-02-24 04:40:08 UTC] tangiwii: i believe
[2019-02-24 04:40:12 UTC] lyshmo1: game looks fun gameplay wise, rest not so much.. maybe because im just not into mech stuff
[2019-02-24 04:40:14 UTC] zombiezlayer99: Did they reintroduce the infinite loading screen because lately i’ve been getting it
[2019-02-24 04:40:35 UTC] dhevoni: loot drop rate are fked right now
[2019-02-24 04:40:47 UTC] dhevoni: you dont get more mws in a gm3 run then in a gm1 run atm
[2019-02-24 04:40:48 UTC] tangiwii: their biggest priorities atm are getting some of the broken mechanics fixed asap. Like the 1million damage storm bug
[2019-02-24 04:40:52 UTC] keyastaron: did u all see the new WQ for the tortollans LUL ?
[2019-02-24 04:40:58 UTC] n8urso: its so weird cause im playing on an Xbox One S and literally I have 0 bugs. couple minor ones on launch day but that was it
[2019-02-24 04:41:03 UTC] dhevoni: 1 million dmg storm bug is fixed already
[2019-02-24 04:41:11 UTC] top_sum: rekt

[2019-02-24 04:43:10 UTC] puredeasil: what difficulty is this
[2019-02-24 04:43:10 UTC] turtledup: @tangiwii Stinks because the game ran smoothly for me pre-release
[2019-02-24 04:43:21 UTC] lucidiousxiv: I just hit 30, at 397, should I stay on hard or go to grandmaster 1? And do i do strongholds or what, now im confused about how to gear cause everything kicks my ass in grandmaster 1 xD
[2019-02-24 04:43:33 UTC] tangiwii: @TurtledUp The issue is the day 1 patch to speed stuff up broke a lot of things that were working fine prior
[2019-02-24 04:43:33 UTC] turtledup: @Keyastaron The game since the last past has caused frame issues to where it just sits still for moments at a time
[2019-02-24 04:43:40 UTC] hxnty42: yo how many strong holds are in this game
[2019-02-24 04:43:43 UTC] turtledup: Also cpu usage for anthem hits 100%

[2019-02-24 04:43:58 UTC] tangiwii: but a 7 min load time just to change gear was extremely excessive
[2019-02-24 04:44:11 UTC] turtledup: @tangiwii It was, but atleast when it loaded I could play lol

[2019-02-24 04:44:47 UTC] turtledup: @tangiwii I have a i7-9900k and a 1070ti
[2019-02-24 04:45:01 UTC] tangiwii: 1070 is like baseline for anthem
[2019-02-24 04:45:01 UTC] harvtv: 7min load time?!?! what are you on a potato?
[2019-02-24 04:45:29 UTC] turtledup: @tangiwii True, but at medium graphics the game should stutter :X
[2019-02-24 04:45:33 UTC] turtledup: shouldn't*
[2019-02-24 04:45:37 UTC] tangiwii: I'm not on a potato. thats literally how the game was pre release
[2019-02-24 04:45:42 UTC] c9_beastyyyywolfyyyy: Which GM?
[2019-02-24 04:45:44 UTC] turtledup: especially when I was playing on ultra with 40-50 pre-release

[2019-02-24 04:46:30 UTC] propwash80: @Big_Whoop how are the shotguns in the game?
[2019-02-24 04:46:32 UTC] tangiwii: The game just needs optimization and polish
[2019-02-24 04:46:35 UTC] horuce: what happened to the fire wall build

[2019-02-24 04:46:59 UTC] big_whoop: @propwash80 shotguns are really strong until GM2, where you have to play a little safer
[2019-02-24 04:47:05 UTC] dhevoni: @ProClicker I got a overclocked 9700k not running hot, watercooled tho 4Head
[2019-02-24 04:47:10 UTC] propwash80: @Big_Whoop what class would you say is the least played?

[2019-02-24 04:47:19 UTC] easyway723: A couple of streamers* "I belive the loot drop rate in to high, whaa,, whaa,, whaa" Anthem devs* -> Nerf the shit out loot boxes.. Anthem community* quits Anthem.."A looter shooter with no loot, thats a great idea"

[2019-02-24 04:48:01 UTC] tangiwii: they fixed the drop rate
[2019-02-24 04:48:08 UTC] dhevoni: they need to revert the loot nerf o

[2019-02-24 04:49:15 UTC] tangiwii: Anyone curious about the issues with the game just go to the bug post in the anthem subreddit
[2019-02-24 04:49:18 UTC] big_whoop: @propwash80 infiltrator might be the class i see in games the least though

[2019-02-24 04:58:17 UTC] sirbeltizar: Yeah they need to increase the rolls on the drops from the higher difficulties so its like a progression to get to the next tier of difficulty.

[2019-02-24 05:14:07 UTC] ravenradiochaos: i don't think that the dungeons need to be made easier so much as the tougher the dungeons the better the gear to match the dungeons. Cause right now what?!?! Legendary is item lvl 47 vs masterwork which is item LvL 45 . so the harder the dungeon the better the gear and weapons. Just my take on it.

[2019-02-24 15:46:52 UTC] saldra740206: this is one of those games to me that i have to ignore reviews and go on my own just cause of how much fun im having with it

[2019-02-24 15:47:23 UTC] tarren604: @zakuzagb the point of a stream being public is to respond to the streamers, communicate as well as playing..

[2019-02-24 15:49:57 UTC] zakuzagb: honestly anthem looks like fun but im unsure if i would keep playing after the first 20 hours or so

[2019-02-24 15:50:34 UTC] tarren604: @dragonofwolves i know he cant reply to every single thing said, but when directed directly at him and tagged as we are doing now, and done so several times, it would be polite to repond..
[2019-02-24 15:50:38 UTC] thunderbrew: @jbmoongirl I have Destiny 2, barely have played it, but thinking about playing a Looter Shooter. Don't know if I should try Destiny 2 or try this?
[2019-02-24 15:50:56 UTC] silentstormred: is anthem worth it?
[2019-02-24 15:50:59 UTC] broomba: @Tarren604 for the record towelliee didnt reach max in 11 hours and max out his gear in that time, he played and reached 30 in over 36 hours and still working on his gears days later, quit watching youtube and actually be a reg in his stream and you might know a little something about facts
[2019-02-24 15:51:06 UTC] silentstormred: I've been contemplating getting it
[2019-02-24 15:51:08 UTC] dreeeewster: @poling622 The reviews have valid arguments tho, not just shit talk :P
[2019-02-24 15:51:27 UTC] jbmoongirl: Why not both? @thunderbrew seriously though, if you can only do one, go where you have the most friends to play with
[2019-02-24 15:51:35 UTC] poling622: @thunderbrew love this game a bunch! But if I were to be 100% honest D2 crushes this game for content, with that being said D2 has also been out for much longer and already has dlcs to keep you playing
[2019-02-24 15:51:38 UTC] d3athwatcher: if you a good looter shooter honestly just go play borderlands 2
[2019-02-24 15:51:41 UTC] blinkheals: @SilentStormRed if you enjoy this type of game and not sure you can try it for $15
[2019-02-24 15:51:46 UTC] traifor: If you play on PC @SilentStormRed for 15 dollars for a month youll absolutely get your moneys worth
[2019-02-24 15:51:52 UTC] mrgrumpleton: yep, we have entered a culture of reviews either being sponsored and controlled by the companies producing the games or by people who make a living off of hate clicks and bandwagonning.

[2019-02-24 15:53:28 UTC] tarren604: @Broomba i never claimed that Towelliee leveled to max in 11 hours, or get max geared in that time, i was talking about a youtube streamer that did that and present it as such causing the game loot system to be nerfed, as a comment to Towelliee in regards to why less legendaries drop now then they did previously
[2019-02-24 15:53:30 UTC] blinkheals: @SilentStormRed just looter shooter. grind same evenets and dungeons over and over for gear

[2019-02-24 15:54:05 UTC] broomba: @Tarren604 you implicated that he did by others and that was being carried to max gear, which is false
[2019-02-24 15:54:11 UTC] poling622: @bryan_terror some people like to keep it for the 35% luck roll on it
[2019-02-24 15:54:21 UTC] broomba: please get rid of the troll tarren604
[2019-02-24 15:54:23 UTC] poling622: @broomba also if your a leggo collector

[2019-02-24 16:06:32 UTC] crossnf: @fistnthepank the 2080Ti is like 20-25% faster than 1080Ti on average, but the regular 2080 is barely better

[2019-02-24 18:31:13 UTC] scorpio1401: I think my issue when playing games this demanding is running it on a native 1440p screen with 2 other 1080p screens in a 3-monitor setup and on one of them I have a stream going. Sometimes I get some of my other programs to stutter a bit but no impact on the game much at all.

[2019-02-24 19:19:35 UTC] krayt360: I'd love to have some content in this game. The gameplay is fun and all, but running the same 3 strongholds and leggo quests is boring af after the 200th time.
[2019-02-24 19:19:36 UTC] dreka: LULW
[2019-02-24 19:19:38 UTC] solarpowerednerdrage: your flight speeds are all the same
[2019-02-24 19:19:41 UTC] maple_media: thats why i dont like gm2 the increased hp and dmg of enemies doesnt make up for the small loot drop %
[2019-02-24 19:19:44 UTC] wazkyr: Div2 Pog
[2019-02-24 19:19:55 UTC] mastersioth: Having played Div 1, I can truthfully say Div 2 is a big improvment
[2019-02-24 19:19:57 UTC] decisive_threat: Div2 is just No..
[2019-02-24 19:19:58 UTC] kraiglooney: @Thead_Enco wait, wut? div2 takes place in Summer. lol
[2019-02-24 19:20:04 UTC] kotobearz: Best part of playing interceptor is playing the game like a Dark souls speed running Feels Good Man
[2019-02-24 19:20:05 UTC] sulvar28: if its like div 1 then i'll hard pass. full of hackers and exploits
[2019-02-24 19:20:11 UTC] mastersioth: The game feels a lot better without the medkit system
[2019-02-24 19:20:12 UTC] merex760: I mean, Div1 got really good. If they can launch Div2 in the state of current Div that'd be sick
[2019-02-24 19:20:17 UTC] elyseums: Div2 is good.. But I've had more fun playing Anthem than the Beta on The Division 2
[2019-02-24 19:20:19 UTC] decisive_threat: Like ghost recon wild lands wasnt even as good as it was anticipated.
[2019-02-24 19:20:20 UTC] swapt1_: Division 2 next wow killer Kappa Kappa
[2019-02-24 19:20:29 UTC] m0us3: The division is just really slow game play wise... its fine... just not my fav
[2019-02-24 19:20:47 UTC] kotobearz: @Elyseums Strongly agree
[2019-02-24 19:20:58 UTC] stixxerz: i also prefer anmthem over division
[2019-02-24 19:21:14 UTC] elyseums: I'm loving Anthem gameplay.. it's so cool the way you fight enemies.. just wait for the improvements and better end game.. we will all be happy Freelancer
[2019-02-24 19:21:18 UTC] pumpthe3rd: I hate how you go into a load screen just to go into the forge
[2019-02-24 19:21:28 UTC] merex760: Anthem gameplay is legit. If they can fix everything else, it'll be awesome
[2019-02-24 19:22:04 UTC] gmo2000: I just tuned in what is the build he is using?
[2019-02-24 19:22:12 UTC] duckforceone: @Towelliee i loved what i have tried of division 2 so far.. going to mix it with anthem to get my tactical feeling on when i don't want to be hulk buster...
[2019-02-24 19:22:18 UTC] mastersioth: Personally Div 2 has way more content than anthem currently has, Anthem has fun gameplay, but very unfulfilling unless you just like to grind.

[2019-02-24 19:22:39 UTC] sollice: How do you know D2 has more content if its in beta
[2019-02-24 19:22:44 UTC] swapt1_: Wooo just need 2 more Corium

[2019-02-24 19:23:31 UTC] larissar: i think the AI movement may need to be adjusted a little bit. a lot of body blocking i assume that clogs up the ramp up there

[2019-02-24 19:24:05 UTC] solarpowerednerdrage: moar fire plz! XD
[2019-02-24 19:24:06 UTC] decisive_threat: still on the ropes for Div2. like I want it to be good. but it really depends what they learned from Div1. and if they implemented it better
[2019-02-24 19:24:08 UTC] zardahl: we have over 80 hours played and only 2 leggos a piece
[2019-02-24 19:24:10 UTC] bearskey: what ilvl is he at now?
[2019-02-24 19:24:18 UTC] hazygreys: is it a component that makes him heal so much?

[2019-02-24 19:27:23 UTC] sulvar28: it doesn't matter, luck drop is just a placebo. I have spent this past week testing between 100% and more vs non and got the same amount of masterwork
[2019-02-24 19:27:37 UTC] pumpthe3rd: @ijuki Ight thx

[2019-02-24 19:28:20 UTC] prologicx: I'm sorry but is it just me that thinks the devs for this are just dumb lol? GM2 is so dumb with full masterworks + legendaries is GM3 even a thing lol
[2019-02-24 19:28:29 UTC] brotherbrent: i got you on the dps
[2019-02-24 19:28:32 UTC] brotherbrent: let me know

[2019-02-24 19:28:45 UTC] mrgattz: its takes months
[2019-02-24 19:28:45 UTC] prologicx: Maybe we'll run GM3 content in a year once we have 4 perfect inscriptions on a character with all legendaries Kappa
[2019-02-24 19:28:49 UTC] brisingr1512: reeeee
[2019-02-24 19:28:50 UTC] villness: For me GM1 is too easy, GM2 is too hard danDead
[2019-02-24 19:28:59 UTC] mastersioth: @Towelliee he probably uses one of those glitches to one shot the boss Kappa

[2019-02-24 19:29:01 UTC] sketchsquadttv: kill all process .bat file would work great with the game @towelliee
[2019-02-24 19:29:17 UTC] prologicx: @MrGattz What about the monitor though? Like he has way too much HP it's just silly, I think everyone realised that on the first run
[2019-02-24 19:29:19 UTC] sketchsquadttv: especially for any bugs
[2019-02-24 19:29:33 UTC] prologicx: And I'm even talking about GM1 (Comparing the monitor to tyrant mine and scar bosses)
[2019-02-24 19:29:43 UTC] sketchsquadttv: ive got the fix for the game crash ad it acting up when you stat it back up
[2019-02-24 19:29:46 UTC] ra1nlol: @Towelliee I feel like tyrant mine has the lowest drop chance for high quality loot, running 10 tyrant mines I've gotten 10 mw, running 10 Scar temple i've gotten atleast 23 mw

[2019-02-24 19:31:18 UTC] prologicx: @MrGattz I'm in the game dev industry, bare in mind this game has been in development for 6 years. Testing just seems like it was skipped in areas of this game

[2019-02-24 21:58:09 UTC] primogeniturej: @n8urso I could see it being hard to get into with the current content, I've been playing for a decade so its kinda my life in my downtime
