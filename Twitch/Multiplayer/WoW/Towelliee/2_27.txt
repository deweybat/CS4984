[2019-02-27 12:50:18 UTC] gustakerg: Yeah - interesting they picked up the Dune franchise. I think the agreement is a minimum of 3 games over 6 years; with one starting pre-production as an "open world multiplayer"
[2019-02-27 12:50:26 UTC] kimberleyblue: @Son_Of_Zion it was really sad, too, it was such a different kind of MMO when it was out, but 2-3 months and it was a ghost town of no content

[2019-02-27 13:35:17 UTC] antdavs24: genuinely asking, rift is still running?
[2019-02-27 13:35:27 UTC] amdekorr: swtor is good well into 2020 they are working on a new ex pac and just released a free one
[2019-02-27 13:35:30 UTC] grittytexan: Star Wars has survived for so long now the only reason I believe they would shut down is just that that they are done working on it
[2019-02-27 13:35:41 UTC] soldierv: SWTOR is no longer canon since Disney
[2019-02-27 13:35:41 UTC] allbeefweiner: @Antdavs24 it is
[2019-02-27 13:35:55 UTC] soldierv: so it probably wont be that much longer for it

[2019-02-27 13:37:06 UTC] xuen1983: there's much older mmo's than WoW stil around
[2019-02-27 13:37:17 UTC] soldierv: they can but it's not considered part of the star wars universe
[2019-02-27 13:37:27 UTC] rytard: swtor has a new expansion coming out later this year, itll be fine for another 2 years
[2019-02-27 13:37:28 UTC] soldierv: it'd be like a side story
[2019-02-27 13:38:01 UTC] timothious: If they are allowed I would just follow the original story line
[2019-02-27 13:38:02 UTC] haxzorjimduggan: fan fiction
[2019-02-27 13:38:08 UTC] ymbsnakeeye: Disney is just selling toys at this point with star wars

[2019-02-27 13:38:37 UTC] soldierv: yeah all those books that were written for star wars before disney? it's all considered non-canon
[2019-02-27 13:38:57 UTC] soldierv: or like fan fiction like HaxzorJimDuggan said
[2019-02-27 13:39:04 UTC] timothious: I liked it but it felt like you were playing in a room when on planets instead of a wide open area
[2019-02-27 13:39:11 UTC] bearlicioussss: pcatsHog LUST
[2019-02-27 13:39:20 UTC] sharie: once the contract endes then yes
[2019-02-27 13:39:22 UTC] rytard: its expanded universe stuff all of it isnt "canon" including like revan and all that shit..
[2019-02-27 13:39:23 UTC] soldierv: they probably can, and buy out of their contract
[2019-02-27 13:39:26 UTC] ymbsnakeeye: it depends on the terms of the license
[2019-02-27 13:39:33 UTC] aeylid: Depends
[2019-02-27 13:39:34 UTC] theunknowing: Not really cause disney licensed EA to make the games, i mean disney can do any thing i guess but ea is licensed to make the games
[2019-02-27 13:39:36 UTC] terribalgamer: ea is in the middle of a 10 year contract with disney for star wars
[2019-02-27 13:39:38 UTC] soldierv: or if they feel that EA isnt representing their IP properly
[2019-02-27 13:39:40 UTC] brewbrewbear: That deal is already signed.

[2019-02-27 13:39:49 UTC] antdavs24: apparently disney is satisfied with how EA is handling their licensing agreement lol
[2019-02-27 13:39:50 UTC] son_of_zion: didnt jedi order got canned?
[2019-02-27 13:39:54 UTC] doublenova: Is star wars the biggest property of all time?
[2019-02-27 13:40:00 UTC] ymbsnakeeye: Disney pulled the plug and they couldn't sell those games for a few years
[2019-02-27 13:40:01 UTC] strayer_j: Im sure the lawyers of the game devs have taken care of that
[2019-02-27 13:40:04 UTC] 3dres: All Disney cares about is cannon content. If it doesn't coincide then they want nothing to do with it. Creativity doesn't go very far in Disney's eyes
[2019-02-27 13:40:08 UTC] ezekyler: if Disney pays EA to take down SWOTR, EEEA will be happy i think

[2019-02-27 13:40:38 UTC] timothious: I was hoping for some good movies when Disney bought it but all they did was make agenda films

[2019-02-27 14:18:31 UTC] sh4nti: Ya the loot is crazy in Division, minmaxing OP weapons etc.
[2019-02-27 14:18:34 UTC] hailstormz: Bought anthem last night, 100% worth it
[2019-02-27 14:18:39 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee IMO the legendary system in Divisioni 1 and 2 is much superior
[2019-02-27 14:18:42 UTC] lugzgaming: From my understanding The Division has an insane level of depth to it. It's a full RPG first, and a shooter 2nd.
[2019-02-27 14:18:49 UTC] doublenova: To mean I like over the top looking gear and Division is just pretty basic looking for a looter shooter
[2019-02-27 14:18:51 UTC] eva_unit_zero: Towelliee is all about the 'ultra legendary" treasure games, not to commons
[2019-02-27 14:18:53 UTC] billowtec: its like the 10 people that play pvp in warframe LUL

[2019-02-27 14:19:49 UTC] draken4o: dark zone used to be the only good gear source at start of division 1.. then they added more pve content so u dont ever have to step in there
[2019-02-27 14:19:59 UTC] yogoe: Dark Zone is kind of like optional end game content, but Division 2 has like endgame dungeons u can do.

[2019-02-27 16:11:28 UTC] zadwanaa: @Hbbillx yeah, why wouldn't they be bullet sponges
[2019-02-27 16:11:29 UTC] zelgodis39: i heard the best way to invite people to this game is through the origin launcher
[2019-02-27 16:11:33 UTC] radrez: anthem's biggest strength is gameplay which is outstanding, if they can fix other problems relativley quick it will be golden :D

[2019-02-27 16:20:30 UTC] zadwanaa: Yeah, the Gunplay in division 1 was fantastic.. the guns felt good...

[2019-02-27 16:21:46 UTC] bigdtfc: i havent gotten any masterwork components from strongholds or legendary missions am i suppose to unlock them somehow
[2019-02-27 16:21:49 UTC] sipherant: omg this bug again
[2019-02-27 16:21:52 UTC] codykb1: @Zadwanaa that is crazy talk!!
[2019-02-27 16:22:03 UTC] zadwanaa: @bigdtfc nope, just lack of RNG :( sorry mate
[2019-02-27 16:22:04 UTC] stickylicious21: @bigdtfc have u done it on GM1?
[2019-02-27 16:22:06 UTC] retrowalker: @Zadwanaa ill play both, but if the loot dosen't get fixed, ill just put this on hold for awhile and play td2 leta them figure out what they want here.
[2019-02-27 16:22:08 UTC] cyvster: I think they are supposed to release a whole new progression system fairly soon. That sounds good
[2019-02-27 16:22:32 UTC] bigdtfc: @stickylicious21 yeah all i do is gm1 maybe just horrible luck?
[2019-02-27 16:22:48 UTC] stickylicious21: @bigdtfc yea ur just unlucky bro
[2019-02-27 16:22:54 UTC] zadwanaa: @retrowalker thats the beauty of it... take a break from anthem and play some TD:2 while they work on more content and fixes, then switch to anthem when TD:2 needs fixes & content, then switch back,t hen switch back
[2019-02-27 16:23:02 UTC] klaatuzu: do ppl ever die doing these missions? they all seem to faceroll content
[2019-02-27 16:23:03 UTC] codykb1: @retrowalker I can't afford both, so i'm just gonna wait until april to decide
[2019-02-27 16:23:13 UTC] bigdtfc: @zadwanaa story of my life rng
[2019-02-27 16:23:18 UTC] bigdtfc: lol
[2019-02-27 16:23:51 UTC] zadwanaa: @bigdtfc bruh... farmed nighthold in wow from release to the guild just outfarmed norms & heroics... and not a single set item for my rogue
[2019-02-27 16:23:52 UTC] stickylicious21: @bigdtfc i did GM1 and i only got components when i wanted weapons geilerKek
[2019-02-27 16:24:02 UTC] retrowalker: I know other games have had loot problems, but after all the looter shooters that have come out. Anthem, should not be having these issues at release, it's not like the pioneered this. Ill say the same for TD2 if it gets messed up, they should get totally jumped on.
[2019-02-27 16:24:10 UTC] zadwanaa: @bigdtfc so im righ there with ya
[2019-02-27 16:24:11 UTC] geesmiley: true

[2019-02-27 16:24:39 UTC] codykb1: @retrowalker "Anthem, should not be having these issues at release," that's been a big point of all this

[2019-02-27 16:25:38 UTC] survdcold: @sipherant yes
[2019-02-27 16:25:39 UTC] triplestruck: @Towelliee how much luck are you running on your current build? should i try to ru more luck to get a better chance for a leggo?
[2019-02-27 16:25:40 UTC] vaprossa: When is new wow patch coming?
[2019-02-27 16:25:49 UTC] crasher0311: But amp up the amount per higher difficulty
[2019-02-27 16:25:50 UTC] zadwanaa: @retrowalker you would think that games would learn off of eachother... but no one ever does. Its sad. We'll see if TD:2 can actually learn from TD:1's mistakes & add in actual QoL... then after sometime after TD:2 is out.. we'll see if Anthem can handle the competition
[2019-02-27 16:26:11 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee no the legendary should be buffed up not the drops
[2019-02-27 16:26:15 UTC] bloodypains: All 5 of my legendary's have been completely worthless, feels really bad
[2019-02-27 16:26:16 UTC] zelgodis39: have not played wow for a couple of years...
[2019-02-27 16:26:22 UTC] zadwanaa: I dont think legos should be 2 i-lvl above MW... i think it should be more. Its Legendary. Things of legends!
[2019-02-27 16:26:28 UTC] enlightning: i managed to get one legendary so far and its a gun increasing weapon damage... im a storm... rip
[2019-02-27 16:26:48 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee you should have to actually complete GM2 before Legendary items are even unlocked for dropping
[2019-02-27 16:26:49 UTC] asurafb6: This is why I watch you, you enjoy games regardless of what people say . I'm loving anthem and I am glad you are too !
[2019-02-27 16:26:50 UTC] cloroxmargarita: there should be guarenteed legendaries for GM3
[2019-02-27 16:26:54 UTC] zelgodis39: but you can share weapons between javalins right?
[2019-02-27 16:27:02 UTC] geesmiley: yep

[2019-02-27 16:27:21 UTC] flyingsloppyjoe: I love how people try to compare the division to anthem when they aren't even the same kind of game. Yeah its loot and shoot but division its more squad and working together.
[2019-02-27 16:27:21 UTC] yellaboy_12: would be nice if there was a lootshare as well
[2019-02-27 16:27:29 UTC] jtfox: I really hope they put certain items and weapons behind grandmaster levels
[2019-02-27 16:27:31 UTC] retrowalker: I have had 12 legendaries drop. 6 of them are the same grenade for my ranger
[2019-02-27 16:27:46 UTC] yellaboy_12: like a open trade window
[2019-02-27 16:27:53 UTC] kingherbie: ive only got 2 legendaries in 100hrs, i wouldnt mind if the masterworks that dropped were actually useful but im hoping todays patch really helps

[2019-02-27 16:29:00 UTC] fiftyfifteen: hi
[2019-02-27 16:29:11 UTC] retrowalker: Interceptor is probably the most crazy powered class, but the learning curve is stupid insane
[2019-02-27 16:29:12 UTC] enlightning: yea loot sharing could cause a shit storm, its probably best not to get into that
[2019-02-27 16:29:12 UTC] toastmask: Im gonna work on the storm next probably.
[2019-02-27 16:29:14 UTC] nullbolt: I would say 75% of the people I've teamed up with are storms

[2019-02-27 16:29:58 UTC] xbabacua: I'd say ranger is the jock and storm is the preppy white kid in AP honor classes @towelliee

[2019-02-27 17:05:15 UTC] smakfulltaco: @tent27 pretty scary how that has suddenly become the norm.. and ppl are ok with it
[2019-02-27 17:05:19 UTC] big_whoop: the blues and greens are not useless. You can use them to craft consumables. Everybody seems to disregard those items though
[2019-02-27 17:05:51 UTC] asurafb6: for the record , I'm a destiny player. got all 3 at 650 right now . But Anthem is MUCH better at launch . And it's just beginning . people need to understand these are live services and you have to slowly release content not everything at launch .
[2019-02-27 17:05:56 UTC] asurafb6: Just adapt to the new gaming industry.
[2019-02-27 17:06:01 UTC] smakfulltaco: @tent27 anthem atm feels like an early access game with pretty graphics
[2019-02-27 17:06:02 UTC] idontmakemybed: @SmakfullTaco its because you have all thsese studio fan bois. talk bad about bungie or bioware see all the defenders come in. people need to get fired

[2019-02-27 17:07:20 UTC] smakfulltaco: @idontmakemybed yea its kinda upsetting seeing so many ppl on reddit blindly defending anthem.. i have 70 hours in anthem.. and i just cant play it anymore.. its so unfinished
[2019-02-27 17:07:21 UTC] silodamilo: "Ultimate won't do as much damage as my gun" Okay, now that's just sad. ultimate should be....ultimate damage.
[2019-02-27 17:07:45 UTC] antdavs24: i mean realistically these games are mmo's without being mmo's, we're not playing the same WoW from launch these 'games as a service' will probably all end up being like that where year 0 is completely different to year 1.... but hey if you're having fun now then great!
[2019-02-27 17:07:48 UTC] idontmakemybed: @SmakfullTaco 70 hrs is alot tho soo.. i've been enjoying it. i think the problem is what was promised

[2019-02-27 17:08:29 UTC] smakfulltaco: @idontmakemybed only reason i stuck with it for so long is because i played with friends and i was hoping there would be more stuff to do

[2019-02-27 17:09:10 UTC] idontmakemybed: @SmakfullTaco they messed up there. right now im level 30 and still have a lot of contracts to do so i dont understand the lack of content yet.. i think they really need quick play to work and put all the missions in there so you can grind out
[2019-02-27 17:09:11 UTC] aplayfulcrab: or just a bad interceptor
[2019-02-27 17:09:14 UTC] big_whoop: colossus is squishiest class imo. even with best defense ability

[2019-02-27 17:09:17 UTC] tent27: What is sad is that people are learning that you don't buy games at launch anymore. You wait for the "Complete" edition 2 that's on sale years after. Otherwise it's nonstop content droughts.

[2019-02-27 17:10:18 UTC] asurafb6: I disagree, I pre order games and I have enjoyed every game I pre ordered. @tent27 What is sad is that people let others opinion impact their own. That is sad, be your own person and go based off your judgement. Anthem had 2 demos, didn't like it ? move on . liked it? pre order and play.

[2019-02-27 17:54:24 UTC] thalomus: nah @Towelliee you're for sure misinformed. stacking over 100% luck bugs it out. It's also confirmed that luck does work to an extent. the way it should work is 100% luck means all loot is upgraded once. Basically for every rare, it's an epic instead

[2019-02-27 18:02:18 UTC] zurgar_: I almost wouldn't call this game a looter shooter. It's a looter, but the shooting is minuscule compared to something like Destiny, where shooting is the game.

[2019-02-27 18:04:42 UTC] clawkiller44: @towelliee 100 luck is fine so for example if you had 163 luck it bugs out and reset once you go past 100 so you would actually only have 63 luck

[2019-02-27 18:10:43 UTC] yelnatz: is the update up?
[2019-02-27 18:10:44 UTC] yelnatz: oh nvm
[2019-02-27 18:10:47 UTC] zadwanaa: hows that an insult?

[2019-02-27 18:11:00 UTC] necrobones1: new update?
[2019-02-27 18:11:08 UTC] thisthc: @xironxxstarx yeah that you were talking about something else.
[2019-02-27 18:11:11 UTC] dhevoni: @Towelliee That's not gonna happen, game will be dead by then
[2019-02-27 18:11:12 UTC] thisthc: thought*
[2019-02-27 18:11:15 UTC] zer0fragz: @Broseidon7624 impact damage is single target dmg. gun is physical dmg
[2019-02-27 18:11:35 UTC] arixtraa: i have a lego pump
[2019-02-27 18:11:36 UTC] geesmiley: we know that they can hotfix some systems..they have that programmed in at least
[2019-02-27 18:12:05 UTC] hbsumo: I get that all the time
[2019-02-27 18:12:10 UTC] sharie: monkaS
[2019-02-27 18:12:25 UTC] shurt123: @Towelliee, what kind of FPS are you getting in Anthem with your 2080 TI? Thinking of getting one myself
[2019-02-27 18:12:26 UTC] geesmiley: but yea, client changes would probably get pushed back to an update window
[2019-02-27 18:12:27 UTC] takosan87: goood game goooood game, but this loot bs remembers me of d3 on launch
[2019-02-27 18:12:30 UTC] dhevoni: I think the actual update will be today
[2019-02-27 18:12:35 UTC] hbsumo: yuup
[2019-02-27 18:12:39 UTC] arixtraa: going to check
[2019-02-27 18:12:39 UTC] crushn_u: i have the leggo truth of tasis

[2019-02-27 18:13:01 UTC] zer0fragz: has anyone had discord problems while playing anthem? during combat discord distorts so much i cant hear my friends at all. and its only with anthem
[2019-02-27 18:13:01 UTC] thisthc: im getting over 100 with a 1070 ti but only in combat ? its weird. flying is 70 LUL
[2019-02-27 18:13:06 UTC] takosan87: ah yeh right i remember that post, it was a wall of text ^^
[2019-02-27 18:13:25 UTC] richiegigas: why does every looter shooter go through this trial of releasing and needing issues to be resolved. Literally every looter shooter all from their own different publishers
[2019-02-27 18:13:36 UTC] dhevoni: lupoRIP
[2019-02-27 18:13:47 UTC] epicsubset: <-- that would be me..
[2019-02-27 18:13:49 UTC] epicsubset: :)
[2019-02-27 18:13:50 UTC] pandadreng: why cant you just run freeplay in private mode.
[2019-02-27 18:13:52 UTC] im_legend: @Towelliee back at lvl 1 i see
[2019-02-27 18:13:55 UTC] brovakiin710: I am bout to say the reddit is nothing much constructive critism and positivity tbh
[2019-02-27 18:14:10 UTC] pandadreng: need to farm creeps but people keep finishing the events.
[2019-02-27 18:14:12 UTC] geesmiley: goals of management versus goals of developing company...different timetables
[2019-02-27 18:14:16 UTC] kromsmash: @Towelliee You gona start a new group? Smash Thic boi here
[2019-02-27 18:14:16 UTC] takosan87: cheer100 NO NO NO THEY NEED TO DATE IT UP TODAY NOT 3.15.2020
[2019-02-27 18:14:35 UTC] zer0fragz: @Pandadreng i dont think itll let you. it foces public qing or to q with your friends
[2019-02-27 18:14:52 UTC] lugzgaming: and let's not forget how good Destiny 2 Forksaken and Warframe are too.
[2019-02-27 18:14:52 UTC] americandeputy: its good to see you branching out though. i mean i love wow and the lore, just lost interest in the game after 11 years
[2019-02-27 18:14:52 UTC] epicsubset: I like Anthem.. but i also didnt expect much from Anthem. I also bought gold edition of Division 2 :)

[2019-02-27 18:15:01 UTC] mrxhandles: is it me or is the legendary contract threat assesment kinda hard on gm1 like the last encounter
[2019-02-27 18:15:05 UTC] zadwanaa: then there's people who say there's too much loot
[2019-02-27 18:15:06 UTC] zandar: ill join you towelliee im on your friends list
[2019-02-27 18:15:07 UTC] lemon_king: There is one more looter shooter coming out later this year.
[2019-02-27 18:15:10 UTC] pulseonline: Did they change the loot again?
[2019-02-27 18:15:10 UTC] kaedus_gaming: WTB a filtered group finder.
[2019-02-27 18:15:12 UTC] dhevoni: Diablo 3, Destiny 2, Division all had terrible launches
[2019-02-27 18:15:15 UTC] im_legend: @Towelliee do you think after this whole loot shit with anthem, that Division dev team is sitting there like *ok bois back to the drawing board and fast!*
[2019-02-27 18:15:24 UTC] xironxxstarx: the health bug is also an issue that needs fixing asap. not sure about PC but on xbox my health fluctuates drastically from one match to the next. and it's not just visual, it's my survivability that fluctuates drastically as well. one GM1 stronghold I can take a bunch of hits from a turret, the next he strips my shields and most of my health with a single bullet.
[2019-02-27 18:15:26 UTC] nasilvera: Going to split my time between both canceled WOW for now
[2019-02-27 18:15:32 UTC] alakablam: division 2 gonna need flying now tho to beat anthem
[2019-02-27 18:15:33 UTC] epicsubset: Happy Pink Shirt Day! btw...
[2019-02-27 18:15:36 UTC] pulseonline: @Towelliee Did they increase the loot drops again? Just logged on
[2019-02-27 18:15:42 UTC] nickinverse: im having a blast with anthem even with the bugs
[2019-02-27 18:16:07 UTC] necrobones1: they wont though
[2019-02-27 18:16:08 UTC] therealm11: yo
[2019-02-27 18:16:10 UTC] cryoustv: can't take the genre by storm with an old game Kappa
[2019-02-27 18:16:10 UTC] lugzgaming: I think The Division 2 is going to be incredible. The devs learned a ton from their mistakes and turned the game into a really good one.
[2019-02-27 18:16:12 UTC] ekstase: and they are doing great tho
[2019-02-27 18:16:13 UTC] thisthc: which really should be a problem. When you have 1000s of combinations of inscriptions it shouldnt matter if people think "its dropping too much" like just let it drop FFS LUL
[2019-02-27 18:16:13 UTC] roflmonsta: but the division 2 is the same as division 1
[2019-02-27 18:16:13 UTC] necrobones1: it will be a mess on laumch
[2019-02-27 18:16:19 UTC] thisthc: shouldnt&
[2019-02-27 18:16:23 UTC] richiegigas: The division 1 already had the formula started at the end of its life cycle, they just need to build off it on to div2
[2019-02-27 18:16:27 UTC] crushn_u: me!
[2019-02-27 18:16:29 UTC] kromsmash: @Towelliee added you
[2019-02-27 18:16:29 UTC] takosan87: i want but im on eu :/
[2019-02-27 18:16:29 UTC] oweuwankenobi: you expecting too much from Ubisoft
[2019-02-27 18:16:31 UTC] epicsubset: D2 looks and feels the same as Division 1 just a new area and a few new gadgets..

[2019-02-27 18:16:53 UTC] dhevoni: destiny 2 was terrible at launch
[2019-02-27 18:16:59 UTC] medwa: Honestly Destiny 2 is in a pretty good place at the moment
[2019-02-27 18:17:00 UTC] geesmiley: lula moving up in power
[2019-02-27 18:17:03 UTC] therealm11: but destiny had a story atleast
[2019-02-27 18:17:05 UTC] rezeon: tbf I'm tempted to just drop a few quid on origin access to play this for a bit to see what I think
[2019-02-27 18:17:05 UTC] nasilvera: The most exciting thing I'm looking forward too is text chat lol
[2019-02-27 18:17:07 UTC] lugzgaming: @EpicSubset that's not a bad thing though. Division 1 has amazing graphics and gameplay.
[2019-02-27 18:17:12 UTC] zandar: @Towelliee im on your friends list zandar
[2019-02-27 18:17:19 UTC] nickinverse: destiny2=destiny1<div2=div1... Anthem is king
[2019-02-27 18:17:31 UTC] grittytexan: No, Destiny 2 came out and everything about Destiny 2 was that they completely changed every single thing and it was fucked to hell
[2019-02-27 18:17:46 UTC] moobot: towHAMUP Thinking of buying a new PC? Origin builds top quality computers that always come with 24/7 customer support from a real person! If you are considering buying an Origin PC, you can check them out HERE: http://www.originpc.com/?aid=1128 towHAMUP
[2019-02-27 18:17:46 UTC] thebronzepanic: I love the game too, but the initial lack of strongholds hurts.
[2019-02-27 18:17:48 UTC] dhevoni: destiny 2 had even less endgame then anthem
[2019-02-27 18:17:50 UTC] zadwanaa: Destiny 2 has a limited shelf life...
[2019-02-27 18:17:51 UTC] dhevoni: on launch
[2019-02-27 18:18:01 UTC] erqmoon: Destiny 2 was the worst game at launch
[2019-02-27 18:18:02 UTC] zer0fragz: @ReZeon thats what im doin. origin premier comes with a lot of cool games along with it too. id say its worth
[2019-02-27 18:18:03 UTC] zadwanaa: Anthem could do so uch more
[2019-02-27 18:18:03 UTC] at1c: @Towelliee Have you gotten any "good" gear from all that gear?

[2019-02-27 18:18:15 UTC] necrobones1: br ResidentSleeper
[2019-02-27 18:18:20 UTC] spajdrex: Tow have you seen entire Anthem team on picture?
[2019-02-27 18:18:22 UTC] nasilvera: Anthem has a great base to build from
[2019-02-27 18:18:25 UTC] therealm11: now way destiny 2 had less endgame than anthem
[2019-02-27 18:18:26 UTC] deadlyguss: launching Anthem and Apex so close together was foolish
[2019-02-27 18:18:27 UTC] drakenking: People who are playing Apex werent going to be buying Anthem
[2019-02-27 18:18:29 UTC] rezeon: I'm mega bored of BR myself lol
[2019-02-27 18:18:41 UTC] lugzgaming: Yea but Destiny 2 already had a huge fan following along with the best gunplay in all of gaming. So the foundation was much stronger to build off of than Anthem. And Bungie has worked on the game and made it amazing over the past year
[2019-02-27 18:18:46 UTC] pulseonline: Did they increase the drop rates? @Towelliee
[2019-02-27 18:18:48 UTC] richiegigas: Hate how BR has infected the minds of every gamer now
[2019-02-27 18:18:48 UTC] drakenking: Two completely separate genres of game, I have 0 interest in Apex but plenty in Anthem
[2019-02-27 18:18:59 UTC] zurgar_: Destiny 2 launch was just farming public events. That's it.
[2019-02-27 18:19:00 UTC] tekneek007: It wouldn't surprise me if some of Anthem's marketing budget was shifted to Apex after it was well received
[2019-02-27 18:19:03 UTC] nickinverse: br is 2017 2018
[2019-02-27 18:19:04 UTC] nasilvera: @therealm11 Destiny 2 had no endgame at launch
[2019-02-27 18:19:05 UTC] medwa: BR is so boring
[2019-02-27 18:19:05 UTC] dhevoni: Bungie didnt communicate at launch either
[2019-02-27 18:19:09 UTC] zadwanaa: @LugzGaming best gunplay? in all of gaming? Whoa... no... im sorry, it absolutely didn't
[2019-02-27 18:19:11 UTC] alakablam: @Richiegigas its just a phase...hopefully
[2019-02-27 18:19:13 UTC] biby07: but... thats like saying Diablo 3 is in the shadow of wow... totally different games
[2019-02-27 18:19:29 UTC] losthero420: @towelliee they fix scars??
[2019-02-27 18:19:35 UTC] medwa: Wish my anthem played as smooth as this lol
[2019-02-27 18:19:35 UTC] lugzgaming: Destiny 2 hands down has the best gunplay. I mean what even competes with it?
[2019-02-27 18:19:41 UTC] tekneek007: Totally different games but those genres tend to burn a lot of player time, so they indirectly compete
[2019-02-27 18:19:41 UTC] kiryn43: thank goodness Anthem didn't try to copy the milestones for powerful gear from Destiny 2. Just play the game and you get loot when it drops, the way it should be.
[2019-02-27 18:19:48 UTC] zurgar_: A third person shooter will never be on top of the category. That's not my personal bias. People play Destiny because of lot and how it feels, and third person shooters can't produce the feel that Destiny can.
[2019-02-27 18:19:53 UTC] richiegigas: @Alakablam its literally all my friends want to play, and its now helping being the two most popular BRs are free to play
[2019-02-27 18:20:05 UTC] cbower91: I‚Äôm loving BR games but they can be a pain in the ass. I got Anthem and I‚Äôm doing my first playthrough tonight though!
[2019-02-27 18:20:09 UTC] zadwanaa: currently? Anthem, The division, just about any BRs
[2019-02-27 18:20:19 UTC] biby07: better gunplay than Destiny 2? CSGO
[2019-02-27 18:20:20 UTC] raz_kaz: Hopefully we get loot updates by 8pm EST. Doubt it gets implemented today. Might be tied to a weekend event
[2019-02-27 18:20:27 UTC] alakablam: @Richiegigas tbh i think thats a big deal of the appeal aswell just the fact that those games are free
[2019-02-27 18:20:35 UTC] zer0fragz: im having a good time playing apex for PvP and anthem for PvE. totally satisfies my gaming needs
[2019-02-27 18:20:46 UTC] drakenking: I already played it, Division 2 is good
[2019-02-27 18:20:52 UTC] cryoustv: @Towelliee the gun sounds honestly killed div2 for me
[2019-02-27 18:20:57 UTC] drakenking: The private beta was fine, pretty much straight upgrade on Division 1
[2019-02-27 18:21:03 UTC] medwa: Anthem gameplay is just so fun and engaging.

[2019-02-27 18:21:27 UTC] nickinverse: anthems flying beats div2 cover mechanics
[2019-02-27 18:21:30 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee I think you might not like TD2, but so far better overall and I like both games

[2019-02-27 18:21:36 UTC] alakablam: @Towelliee i just wonder how much content they have to sell through the store to consider a game like apex succesfull...i guess they cant go on installs alone

[2019-02-27 18:22:42 UTC] nasilvera: But that's how these types games are they are developed with an MMO mentally without being a pure MMO and people can't wrap their heads around that a game with constant updates and these updates will be free that's also overlooked
[2019-02-27 18:22:43 UTC] richiegigas: Bungie needs to get Halo back and return xbox to the glory days

[2019-02-27 18:23:00 UTC] lugzgaming: Anthem looks pretty but the gunplay is just really weak and gutless. I get that the game favors abilities over guns, which is fine, but I prefer the Destiny 2 model where gunpaly is top of the line and abilities are secondary. Just a preference I suppose.
[2019-02-27 18:23:18 UTC] zer0fragz: 45 million pepegas lirikFR

[2019-02-27 18:24:43 UTC] roflmonsta: division 2 is division 1 remastered WutFace
[2019-02-27 18:24:46 UTC] zadwanaa: so priority & top of the line are 2 seperate things. Destiny either didnt want skills to be a major factor or they didn't tink about it... but the guns in Destiny 2 are bleh unless you get an exotic.
[2019-02-27 18:24:57 UTC] lugzgaming: Destiny 2 and Division 2 also have pvp which is a huge advantage over Anthem imo.
[2019-02-27 18:24:59 UTC] zer0fragz: @LugzGaming I just scooped up a MW lmg and it wrecks things with the right build. its def possible
[2019-02-27 18:25:04 UTC] nick_venture: The Division: Again
[2019-02-27 18:25:08 UTC] nickinverse: div2 betas were boringggg
[2019-02-27 18:25:11 UTC] ghost_tom: the interceptor build that lets you have unlimited sniper ammo is broken af
[2019-02-27 18:25:15 UTC] roflmonsta: @Nick_Venture LOL
[2019-02-27 18:25:20 UTC] tannersrk: is that the shotgun that gives back shield?
[2019-02-27 18:25:26 UTC] kaikosan: Good evening @Towelliee
[2019-02-27 18:25:39 UTC] pumpthe3rd: Chat I like being attack and defensive but also a bit mobile who do I be?
[2019-02-27 18:25:47 UTC] zer0fragz: oh nice dude you been doing that? been thinking about doing the prep meal stuff
[2019-02-27 18:25:49 UTC] richiegigas: I swear the scar hunters are the most annoying motherfuckers in the game lol
[2019-02-27 18:25:50 UTC] zadwanaa: its a lot more than possible... there's plenty of mostly gun builds... also plenty of builds with skills. Thats the beauty over a game like destiny... you can have vastly different builds
[2019-02-27 18:25:52 UTC] retrowalker: Hoping both games work out well. I have unsubbed to wow.
[2019-02-27 18:25:57 UTC] nasilvera: @pumpthe3rd Ranger
[2019-02-27 18:25:59 UTC] soul_killer86: If you miss an item to pickup does it get mailed to you after the mission like in destiny?
[2019-02-27 18:26:04 UTC] zadwanaa: @Richiegigas completely agree. theyre broken. They need to be toned down
[2019-02-27 18:26:06 UTC] omniton: aye
[2019-02-27 18:26:11 UTC] miguel85nyc: towelliee just saw your review for anthem, they are adding guilds to the game and should be soon ish
[2019-02-27 18:26:16 UTC] lugzgaming: @Zer0FragZ I'm not talking so much about effectiveness but more the feel of gunplay. Destiny 2 guns just feel and sound better to use. And Anthem abilities look and feel better to use than Destiny
[2019-02-27 18:26:22 UTC] nasilvera: @retrowalker Same will enjoy both
[2019-02-27 18:26:24 UTC] audiononsense: PumpThe3rd sums up Ranger nicely
[2019-02-27 18:26:34 UTC] zer0fragz: @Soul_Killer86 i think so because i got a MW last night and dont remember picking it up. not sure about epics blues and greens tho
[2019-02-27 18:26:43 UTC] pumpthe3rd: Already thx @audiononsense @nasilvera
[2019-02-27 18:26:50 UTC] richiegigas: @Zadwanaa tanky as hell and they shred you if they're locked onto you lmao
[2019-02-27 18:26:50 UTC] pumpthe3rd: Alright*
[2019-02-27 18:26:53 UTC] knarp: good for the eagles to let him choose the team he wants
[2019-02-27 18:26:58 UTC] soul_killer86: Ah ok ty @zer0fragz
[2019-02-27 18:27:03 UTC] yellaboy_12: just dont get your hopes down if the beta sucks
[2019-02-27 18:27:16 UTC] yellaboy_12: last beta sucked really bad to many bugs
[2019-02-27 18:27:26 UTC] drakenking: ???
[2019-02-27 18:27:27 UTC] shemstar: Theradrad does good ones
[2019-02-27 18:27:29 UTC] pumpthe3rd: Brad

[2019-02-27 18:27:35 UTC] justmarctho: the beta was fine lol
[2019-02-27 18:27:37 UTC] drakenking: I dont think I ran into a single bug in the Division 2 beta
[2019-02-27 18:27:47 UTC] yellaboy_12: so many people were getting banned

[2019-02-27 18:27:57 UTC] pumpthe3rd: Radbrad is the goat of let‚Äôs plays and play throughs
[2019-02-27 18:28:03 UTC] drakenking: my audio dipped a bit
[2019-02-27 18:28:06 UTC] flit1: You able to craft any masterwork gear yet ?
[2019-02-27 18:28:06 UTC] zer0fragz: @LugzGaming forsure. but like that other guy said anthem isnt a shooter first. its the abilities that really shine
[2019-02-27 18:28:09 UTC] drakenking: but that was the only issue
[2019-02-27 18:28:21 UTC] zadwanaa: @LugzGaming its easy for skills to feel better... because destiny has trash abilities... the shotguns aren't impressive in Destiny 2... neither are the bows. maybe if you loved halo and just completely prefer you a game like halo... you'll be pretty biased about it. You'll favor a halo clone which is what Destiny is
[2019-02-27 18:28:32 UTC] sharie: bit sceptical of Division 2 because i really loved Snowy New York
[2019-02-27 18:28:34 UTC] losthero420: son of a...im stuck in a wall
[2019-02-27 18:28:39 UTC] drakenking: Its the same looting system as division 1 mostly
[2019-02-27 18:28:42 UTC] drakenking: a little optimized
[2019-02-27 18:28:50 UTC] sipherant: oh sure he gets to salvage in the field
[2019-02-27 18:28:55 UTC] zadwanaa: @sharie omg i know.. i wanted so much more.... you can do the entire east coast!
[2019-02-27 18:28:58 UTC] drakenking: This is on an easy mode also
[2019-02-27 18:29:00 UTC] retrowalker: @Towelliee the game play is different end game fyi

[2019-02-27 18:29:16 UTC] roflmonsta: Division1 enemies were sponges
[2019-02-27 18:29:17 UTC] ptkiska: played a lot of dv1 and I enjoyed dv2 beta more than I did dv1.
[2019-02-27 18:29:27 UTC] lugwell: @Dhevoni I was about to say that lul
[2019-02-27 18:29:31 UTC] militaryrednek: ive played div2 since the alpha and im loving it. only thing i miss from div1 is the pulse ability. i only really pve though, not much pve.
[2019-02-27 18:29:42 UTC] zadwanaa: @Drelnar he wasn't lv 30..
[2019-02-27 18:29:51 UTC] mr_moose101: speechless
[2019-02-27 18:30:03 UTC] trafikk_: Division combat is rather dull tbh.... cover shooter....spongey mobs etc
[2019-02-27 18:30:08 UTC] tannersrk: what's the fastest stronghold to farm?
[2019-02-27 18:30:17 UTC] therealm11: deadly paintball gunz
[2019-02-27 18:30:27 UTC] zadwanaa: actually, that SMG sounded good.
[2019-02-27 18:30:30 UTC] rezeon: Pulse is still in it isn't it. It's just not available in the beta
[2019-02-27 18:30:37 UTC] og_fear: @Towelliee Gotta dip someone else can have my spot gotta get some things done b4 heading into work today

[2019-02-27 18:30:39 UTC] yelnatz: cross hair
[2019-02-27 18:30:41 UTC] nickinverse: flying is more fun then div2 cover
[2019-02-27 18:30:41 UTC] zadwanaa: it wasn't overly exaggerated... its a SMG, not an assault rifle
[2019-02-27 18:30:43 UTC] sharie: Disivion 2 still has no P90 =(
[2019-02-27 18:30:43 UTC] therealm11: cross hair?

[2019-02-27 18:30:49 UTC] drelnar: @Zadwanaa Kappa
[2019-02-27 18:30:53 UTC] lugzgaming: @Zadwanaa I guess that just comes down to opinion. I love using shotguns on Destiny 2 because they have huge impact and I "feel" like I'm shooting a shotgun. And yes Halo is one of the best shooters of all time and Destiny 2 is the closest I'll get to playing Halo on PC.
[2019-02-27 18:30:56 UTC] midnighttangentryan: Is there an official time they will be letting us know about the loot?
[2019-02-27 18:31:02 UTC] dhevoni: I hate the whole powerful gear system in destiny 2
[2019-02-27 18:31:04 UTC] ghost_tom: fastest MW atm is farming last boss on tyrant mine

[2019-02-27 18:31:20 UTC] tannersrk: doesn't last boss only give abilities?
[2019-02-27 18:31:24 UTC] ghost_tom: or farming last objective on legendary contracts
[2019-02-27 18:31:25 UTC] losthero420: losthero666
[2019-02-27 18:31:34 UTC] vyjinx: the item stats depth is way better in division tho
[2019-02-27 18:31:34 UTC] lugzgaming: @Towelliee why don't you try Destiny 2 then?
[2019-02-27 18:31:40 UTC] vyjinx: imo anyway
[2019-02-27 18:31:41 UTC] therealinsan3d: destiny 2 armor looks like trash
[2019-02-27 18:32:00 UTC] sharie: thats whyi cant play Path of Exile because it looks liek Crap
[2019-02-27 18:32:02 UTC] tekneek007: so basically get Anthem out of the Frostbite engine Kappa
[2019-02-27 18:32:06 UTC] zurgar_: If you want amazing guns, play destiny. These other looters don't care about the shooting.
[2019-02-27 18:32:08 UTC] therealinsan3d: some of the ships in destiny 2 look like they are office supplies 3D scanned in lol
[2019-02-27 18:32:18 UTC] drelnar: why games can't have everything ? FeelsBadMan it's either content / design / fun / replayability but never all together :(
[2019-02-27 18:32:18 UTC] retrowalker: Anthem would make a great season / non-season game imo.
[2019-02-27 18:32:18 UTC] audiononsense: Real Cardinal was hired late in the project to do sound design for the abilities and Javelin sounds, super talented guy.
[2019-02-27 18:32:45 UTC] lugzgaming: Destiny 2 just has as different art style, that's all

[2019-02-27 18:32:47 UTC] zadwanaa: @LugzGaming :P Yeah... i kinda figured tbh... most of the die hard destiny people are die hard halo fans... but im sorry. Halo isn't the best. Thats purely opinion. To me... nothing beats CoD: MW1. Easily the best FPS, best guns, amazing maps. I understand what you're saying.. but you're throwing opinion around as a fact
[2019-02-27 18:32:55 UTC] pumpthe3rd: What shotgun is this?
[2019-02-27 18:32:59 UTC] therealinsan3d: destiny 1 armor sets looked great
[2019-02-27 18:33:00 UTC] sunnz_lfc: i find it funny when people say destiny has better gunplay and guns, ofcouse it does because thats all it has to offers LUL
[2019-02-27 18:33:22 UTC] retrowalker: farm up those commons boys
[2019-02-27 18:33:25 UTC] lugzgaming: @Zadwanaa well to be fair I said Halo was one of the best shooters, not the best shooter.
[2019-02-27 18:33:29 UTC] therealm11: i wonder what happens if u dont destroy the alarms???
[2019-02-27 18:33:41 UTC] peacesilencer: anyone know if you actually hald top pick up the loot or if you skip it you still receave at end
[2019-02-27 18:33:51 UTC] pumpthe3rd: @therealm11 You have to or else you can‚Äôt proceed I to the stronghold

[2019-02-27 18:34:12 UTC] necrobones1: @Towelliee what do you think is the best colossus weapon atm? Fist of stral?
[2019-02-27 18:34:15 UTC] therealm11: @PumpThe3rd but do u get an uber amount of enemies?
[2019-02-27 18:34:15 UTC] retrowalker: @Thuum_ what weapons you using?
[2019-02-27 18:34:46 UTC] sunnz_lfc: i put over 300 hours into division 1, towards the end ( 2017) div1 was pretty damn perfect with loot, activities and survival/expansion and never felt boring but the beta for 2 i got bored after 4 hours, the gameplay after the anthem demo is why i think

[2019-02-27 19:03:17 UTC] zadwanaa: @Nick_Venture and you're 1100% right... Bluehole hates the playerbase it seems
[2019-02-27 19:03:27 UTC] reapergt350: people are too quick to jump on the hate bandwagon. Hating something is the new cool thing to do, and if anyone dares to like something, then they are somehow a bad person...

[2019-02-27 19:04:33 UTC] cerpinconsafo: you can't tell me a seasoned Dev can't put a chat engine in their game because it took too much time and resources...that's basic stuff
[2019-02-27 19:04:37 UTC] n8urso: to be honest what im starting to think is that whatever they worked on for the first few years of anthems development got scrapped and they had to start over a few years ago. just doesn't add up if that's not the case

[2019-02-27 19:05:28 UTC] s7wede: @Towelliee Could it be the case that because of Activision, certain developers who were more in line with the philosophy of Activision were given priority in the decision making department? Could it not be argued then that a purely Blizzard BFA would have turned out differently?
[2019-02-27 19:05:30 UTC] retrowalker: the chat and QoL stuff is definitely biowares fault for whatever weird ass reason

[2019-02-27 19:05:58 UTC] nick_venture: Yup, communication. Who knew?
[2019-02-27 19:06:00 UTC] hutchpoker: if they add a chat its just going to turn into people arguing in chat and not playing while the other 2 in the party do all the work
[2019-02-27 19:06:00 UTC] imtherealgoose: Im enjoying the game for what it is, and the hope is as the game gains notoriety we will see better developments that suit gamers current needs

[2019-02-27 19:06:32 UTC] nickinverse: the game is going to be built around guilds, not single players chatting, everyone will be in discord
[2019-02-27 19:06:35 UTC] n8urso: @Towelliee I feel like they scrapped what they were working on at some point over the 6 year span. it doesn't add up that this is a complete 6 year product with a large budget.
[2019-02-27 19:06:44 UTC] instant_savage: @Towelliee check out asmongold gardening stream lol

[2019-02-27 19:14:41 UTC] thisthc: would be amazing if the epic contract quick plays were working. would be worth queuing for quick play.
[2019-02-27 19:14:41 UTC] eric_the_guapo: i hope they fix quick play. I get stuck in loading screens and load into missions with no objective markers, it sucks
[2019-02-27 19:15:30 UTC] ponts: @Towelliee this is late cuz 6min to chat. :( My guess on chat is actually that the laws changed on dec 2018 about chat. I think EA saying "this is your launch date" could definitely have caused lots of cuts to happen from the studios real vision
[2019-02-27 19:15:53 UTC] delaredia: QUICKPLAY missions always break when the leader who started the mission leaves play or the game. meanwhile, you will get queued into this broken missions which can no longer be completed. Was running about 10% success over the weekend, and now its up to about 30%. Still bad, but it looks like they are working on it

[2019-02-27 19:16:51 UTC] delaredia: if you run quickplay on easy or normal, the success rate is higher because you get matched with people running the main story missions

[2019-02-27 20:22:15 UTC] biscuitness: 50-60c seems a bit high, right?
[2019-02-27 20:22:23 UTC] skweakz: dam my 2080 is 55 and my 8700k is 65
[2019-02-27 20:22:29 UTC] phowecy: nah
[2019-02-27 20:22:29 UTC] dethmold187: 50-60 is fine if you are on air and not water cooled
[2019-02-27 20:22:32 UTC] captainredbeardtv: nah 50-60 is pretty normal
[2019-02-27 20:22:36 UTC] kingsto: 50-60 is good temp
[2019-02-27 20:22:44 UTC] skweakz: are mine high for air?
[2019-02-27 20:22:45 UTC] derzlok: i play wow and mine is 30 for wow 50-60 for anthem
[2019-02-27 20:22:46 UTC] phowecy: 70-80 is high
[2019-02-27 20:22:48 UTC] sasinyamada: is it worth doing gm2 yet

[2019-02-27 20:23:06 UTC] allmmight: why does your colossal look like barney ?
[2019-02-27 20:23:15 UTC] derzlok: prob could do with having to be plugged into a 42 inch tv though right?

[2019-02-27 20:23:50 UTC] nick_venture: You get get throttling
[2019-02-27 20:23:51 UTC] wet_sushiroli: yeah same i have a 8700k and im not going above 45
[2019-02-27 20:24:03 UTC] skweakz: on water or air?
[2019-02-27 20:24:05 UTC] deathlyst: just need a custom water kit for your gpu and cpu
[2019-02-27 20:24:08 UTC] diearc13: if you're not thermal throttling it should be fine
[2019-02-27 20:24:11 UTC] wet_sushiroli: water
[2019-02-27 20:24:12 UTC] deathlyst: its op for cooling
[2019-02-27 20:24:15 UTC] fibbo1: Im pc illiterate is it possible to run this game on i5 2500k at around 60 fps on low settings
[2019-02-27 20:24:18 UTC] sniperbob76: im more concerned with the read/write on the SSD than my CPU temps with this game
[2019-02-27 20:24:18 UTC] dragonkiller1974: most cpu's don't throttle till 100C
[2019-02-27 20:24:32 UTC] wet_sushiroli: rtx cards close down at 92c now
[2019-02-27 20:24:40 UTC] wet_sushiroli: and cpu is like 95
[2019-02-27 20:24:42 UTC] derzlok: question if i go from 42inch tv to 24inch monitor will i see decrease in temps
[2019-02-27 20:24:45 UTC] skweakz: my 8700k is @ 60-65 in this game. is that high for air?
[2019-02-27 20:24:59 UTC] wet_sushiroli: no @sKweakZ
[2019-02-27 20:25:00 UTC] kiryn43: no that's good for air.
[2019-02-27 20:25:04 UTC] deathlyst: 75 is high tho
[2019-02-27 20:25:11 UTC] wet_sushiroli: NO ITS NOT lol @DeathLyst
[2019-02-27 20:25:17 UTC] wet_sushiroli: 70-75 is normal
[2019-02-27 20:25:20 UTC] jericco8: 75 is not high
[2019-02-27 20:25:36 UTC] derzlok: cpu now a day their max is 100
[2019-02-27 20:25:36 UTC] wet_sushiroli: for a non water cooled GPU @DeathLyst its fine
[2019-02-27 20:25:45 UTC] poniiee: what the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuudge. got a component with 4 armor + 21% max inscriptions
[2019-02-27 20:25:47 UTC] skweakz: is a water cooler for my cpu worth getting?

[2019-02-27 20:25:52 UTC] deathlyst: yeah im just used to staying below 60 @wet_sushirolI
[2019-02-27 20:25:59 UTC] wet_sushiroli: @sKweakZ maybe
[2019-02-27 20:26:07 UTC] derzlok: skweakz i just got it and i still get 50 in anthem but idk if cause on a big tv
[2019-02-27 20:26:33 UTC] deathlyst: custom loops are generally cheaper too just takes cutting tubes n such to get the fitting right
[2019-02-27 20:26:44 UTC] dethmold187: Holy shit, Alex Jones is back on Joe Rogan!
[2019-02-27 20:26:56 UTC] skweakz: are close looped ones good? i just dont like the idea of water in my pc
[2019-02-27 20:27:06 UTC] poniiee: oh nvm. loot screen is bugged. all 24 items have 4 armor inscriptions. lol
[2019-02-27 20:27:15 UTC] derzlok: can someone plz answer if going to a 24inch montior will reduce heat
[2019-02-27 20:27:19 UTC] wet_sushiroli: Water cooling for CPU , is only needed if u have the K versions right because there base clock is higher and for the case of overclocking thats why u need watrer cooling , but for normal gaming and not using the K version CPU , u can easy sustain a good Degree with an air cooler
[2019-02-27 20:27:20 UTC] sniperbob76: RIP
[2019-02-27 20:27:21 UTC] strixdev: @derzlok no too sure but I am pretty sure the physical size of a screen has nothing to do with performance, unless they are different resolutions
[2019-02-27 20:27:22 UTC] deathlyst: @sKweakZ its a closed loop, if its open waster would get out :P
[2019-02-27 20:27:26 UTC] ka5h3d: F
[2019-02-27 20:27:30 UTC] maardal: F

[2019-02-27 20:27:32 UTC] wet_sushiroli: @derzlok yes and better frames
[2019-02-27 20:27:34 UTC] deathlyst: its just a custom kit that splits the loop to gpu and cpu instead of just one of em
[2019-02-27 20:27:35 UTC] sniperbob76: sumRip sumRip
[2019-02-27 20:27:37 UTC] seacrestslayer: I'm not getting that
[2019-02-27 20:27:39 UTC] sillo: happened to me
[2019-02-27 20:27:43 UTC] cryoustv: @Towelliee it's an issue with the mission, nothing to do with quickplay
[2019-02-27 20:27:46 UTC] sprucemoose: That happened to me a few minutes ago
[2019-02-27 20:27:47 UTC] spiderbyt3s: i finally get a masterwork and my game crashed out, will i get it back if i run another contract?

[2019-02-27 20:27:58 UTC] derzlok: thats prob why heats up then when i play anthem
[2019-02-27 20:27:59 UTC] daihenka: You will need to restart Anthem

[2019-02-27 20:28:19 UTC] sprucemoose: I just had to leave a bugged lobby
[2019-02-27 20:28:20 UTC] fate090: @DeathLyst Yupperz. I built a custom loop from my gpu to the cpu then the radiator and go back to pump and then to gpu again
[2019-02-27 20:28:20 UTC] althamos: never had this happen yet on ps4
[2019-02-27 20:28:21 UTC] feelurself_: how's the colossus coming
[2019-02-27 20:28:21 UTC] daihenka: Had it earlier in a legendary contract
[2019-02-27 20:28:26 UTC] deathlyst: give yourself a few inches extra to make sure it reaches
[2019-02-27 20:28:27 UTC] captainredbeardtv: i'm assuming avenging herald passive stacking has been patched out right?
[2019-02-27 20:28:29 UTC] spiderbyt3s: yea server shit at the end right now.
[2019-02-27 20:28:32 UTC] poniiee: @Towelliee litteraly every single item piece is 21% max armor inscription. think the game broke just now
[2019-02-27 20:28:33 UTC] sasinyamada: everyone and their mother is running damn storm
[2019-02-27 20:28:39 UTC] nick_venture: My quest just bugged out
[2019-02-27 20:28:45 UTC] lugwell: Anthem crashed eventually while i tried to wait it out
[2019-02-27 20:28:48 UTC] deathlyst: @Fate090 yeah custom loops are great, fun to put together too
[2019-02-27 20:28:48 UTC] spacifico11: same thing happened to me yesterday
