[2019-02-23 02:52:40 UTC] ninjaramboman: @Meraut I'm only level 11 so yeah I can't really say. I know I mained Interceptor at first but enjoy Colossus soooooo much more.
[2019-02-23 02:52:47 UTC] major_warzone: i think ranger has the worst masterworks but its also like the most well rounded
[2019-02-23 02:52:51 UTC] meraut: Colossus is op imo
[2019-02-23 02:52:51 UTC] remokiss: @Meraut once you get the melee legendary components say that agien :P as you can do over 100k in melee hits with em
[2019-02-23 02:53:09 UTC] crowguy: @Towelliee Would you say the drops are still buffed? I haven't been watching for a few hours, last I saw you were getting 7-8 Masters on GM1 and then all purples and blues on GM2???
[2019-02-23 02:53:11 UTC] major_warzone: i wish running in water while on fire removed the fire
[2019-02-23 02:53:13 UTC] ninjaramboman: @Meraut I feel the same!
[2019-02-23 02:53:18 UTC] meraut: Well not op, colossus just feels right i think the other javelins need some work
[2019-02-23 02:53:20 UTC] chibibibaby: how is colossus OP @Meraut explain pls
[2019-02-23 02:53:20 UTC] wasabifh: @Major_Warzone too many are melee focused
[2019-02-23 02:53:37 UTC] ninjaramboman: LUL use Colossus and you will see why

[2019-02-23 02:59:32 UTC] meraut: basically "freeplay"
[2019-02-23 02:59:36 UTC] ninjaramboman: @chibibibaby Or Strongholds, for now.
[2019-02-23 02:59:45 UTC] meraut: I don't like the fact you can't target loot
[2019-02-23 02:59:54 UTC] chibibibaby: theres only one stronghold currently right?
[2019-02-23 02:59:58 UTC] chibibibaby: the tyrant mine?
[2019-02-23 03:00:00 UTC] meraut: 3
[2019-02-23 03:00:04 UTC] ninjaramboman: No 3

[2019-02-23 03:00:25 UTC] solarpowerednerdrage: If you're just going for the sweetest of loot, Tyrant mine gives the most frequent chest drops, besides freeplay events

[2019-02-23 03:00:29 UTC] ailwuful: I guess it's unfair to compare this game to Warframe, though
[2019-02-23 03:00:32 UTC] chibibibaby: Do i have to finish the legionnaires challenge first? to continue the story?
[2019-02-23 03:00:33 UTC] ailwuful: Warframe has been around for years
[2019-02-23 03:00:34 UTC] og_kawngi: there's only 1 while you level, other 2 are when you beat campaign

[2019-02-23 03:00:43 UTC] meraut: LEGIONNAIRES LUL
[2019-02-23 03:00:47 UTC] aufidius3: Endgame is free play, strongholds, and legendary contracts until legendary story quests and mastery system get added.
[2019-02-23 03:00:53 UTC] meraut: So, so, so bad story design
[2019-02-23 03:00:54 UTC] ninjaramboman: Look up the Roadmap for act 1, there isn't much on it detail wise but they did discuss in a interview what to expect in act 1.
[2019-02-23 03:01:05 UTC] meraut: Yes, the legionnaires are the main story
[2019-02-23 03:01:39 UTC] ninjaramboman: @Ailwuful Yeah I believe with time this game will be amazing!

[2019-02-23 21:24:34 UTC] jayrokjm: i dunno, this game needs pvp, feels super repetitive, not happy while playing it
[2019-02-23 21:24:41 UTC] zoddamhai: i want metacritics to make there own game and then we will see il porbably give it 1/10

[2019-02-23 21:25:16 UTC] wrizzik: last I saw, it was 62%; which hilariously lined up with special chocolate bars that the devs had made for the game release (which were 62% cocoa and had a big "62%" on the front of the bar wrapper)
[2019-02-23 21:25:18 UTC] zoddamhai: #metacritic suck my dick

[2019-02-23 21:32:04 UTC] smakfulltaco: @MStewGT yea im 99% sure that gear icon means its for the item/weapon and the javelin icon means its overall increase so gear icon with elemental on a physcial weapon is pretty poo
[2019-02-23 21:32:05 UTC] crossnf: Yeah but that's stupid. Epic components are super weak @Towelliee
[2019-02-23 21:32:08 UTC] scobasteve: so like my 35% ele dmg comp and the same version thats MW stack together for 70%
[2019-02-23 21:32:32 UTC] crossnf: @Scobasteve Yeah, but masterwork components give so much more armor and shields

[2019-02-23 23:17:45 UTC] geauxgetta504: Shock Coil with Ice Freeze trait is sick

[2019-02-23 23:18:08 UTC] dgall: Warframe rather... I never played either
[2019-02-23 23:18:09 UTC] geauxgetta504: @dgall Anthem really isn't like either... .the loot system and grind is more Diablo than those 2

[2019-02-23 23:18:50 UTC] geauxgetta504: Warframe is about obtaining the loot.... Anthem isn't acquring as much... it's more about the rolls like Diablo.

[2019-02-23 23:20:14 UTC] biby07: i love warframe, but atm its not good for starting players... BUT DE is working on making some "tutorial" like shit
[2019-02-23 23:20:17 UTC] kaikosan: yeah for some reason the WF people really want to help eachother. It's weird after you encountered so much toxicity in other games

[2019-02-23 23:20:59 UTC] phen1214: lots of salt in destiny
[2019-02-23 23:21:01 UTC] kaikosan: Let's play a looter shooter! Oh i gotta grind?! Fuck this.
[2019-02-23 23:21:06 UTC] blastaho: What do u think about division
[2019-02-23 23:21:09 UTC] mrjekyll16: So far hasn't been positive aswell in most chats.
[2019-02-23 23:21:10 UTC] dgall: Does Anthem have rpg style leveling and traits?
[2019-02-23 23:21:10 UTC] blastaho: ?
[2019-02-23 23:21:18 UTC] geauxgetta504: Yea I saw a review that said the problem is Anthem is that "You loot and that's it..."
[2019-02-23 23:21:18 UTC] mrjekyll16: Anthem*
[2019-02-23 23:21:19 UTC] dgall: or gear level? any of that stuff
[2019-02-23 23:21:19 UTC] jayviray29: is this the new iron man game that just released
[2019-02-23 23:21:24 UTC] n8urso: theres a difference between grinding and playing the literal same mission over and over (warframe)
[2019-02-23 23:21:31 UTC] sketchsquadttv: game engines and technology will change to holographic and change it up a little, but these are extensions of our bodies . if we as a soiety were able to use more percentages of our brain reality as we know it would shift paradimically

[2019-02-23 23:23:44 UTC] mrjekyll16: @Brovakiin710 i think Dragon Age is first. Mass effect is a long way out
[2019-02-23 23:23:47 UTC] geauxgetta504: @Provision_ That's Anthem so people are either gonna like it or not.... I love Diablo PoE style of looter so that's why i'm over 100hrs in LUL

[2019-02-23 23:24:59 UTC] geauxgetta504: @Provision_ yea the game def needs some polishing but i'm extremely happy with the foundation.
[2019-02-23 23:25:12 UTC] elaphros: you have to go back to easy to get geared up
[2019-02-23 23:25:13 UTC] geauxgetta504: @sh4d0wz_tv nah you just need to acquire gear.

[2019-02-23 23:25:33 UTC] shroudsfleshlight: you watch how enjoyable this game will be, once they kill off obsolete inscriptions on gear IE: combo damage on flamethrower. and theyre gonna add reforging inscriptions like wow
[2019-02-23 23:25:45 UTC] n8urso: ^^^

[2019-02-23 23:26:26 UTC] misterheatmiser9: Youve got weapons and some components, but abilites you have to get
[2019-02-23 23:26:36 UTC] crusadernero: you mean when the game is 100% ready? Kappa
[2019-02-23 23:26:42 UTC] shroudsfleshlight: once they kill off shitty inscirptions where they are useless on some certain items the loot will actually feel 100% rewarding
[2019-02-23 23:26:43 UTC] angiergaming: the game is now out for just a week. any judgement about its ability to retain players as of now is just talking out of our asses. we'll have to wait and see how Bioware keeps at it.
[2019-02-23 23:26:50 UTC] schluky: i think the action, the gameplay is probably the most appealing ive ever felt
[2019-02-23 23:26:56 UTC] shroudsfleshlight: and you wont be hitting like a wet noddle

[2019-02-23 23:46:32 UTC] gopnikmedic: New original idea comes out like anthem and everyone trashes it
[2019-02-23 23:46:37 UTC] mett7: Its similar, same story
[2019-02-23 23:46:41 UTC] gopnikmedic: meanwhile someone is jerking off over yet another remaster of an old game
[2019-02-23 23:46:42 UTC] gopnikmedic: yawn
[2019-02-23 23:46:47 UTC] aeylid: Same but different in so many ways
[2019-02-23 23:46:56 UTC] cilir: some of it is the same but they changed it pretty good to make it feel new
[2019-02-23 23:47:01 UTC] fistnthepank: ITS DELISIOUS
[2019-02-23 23:47:08 UTC] chillos_gaming: ape
[2019-02-23 23:47:23 UTC] callmeclutch40: Do you think EA will keep there promise for this game. Planning on buying it today just dont wanna have high hopes for something and they dont follow through
[2019-02-23 23:47:52 UTC] fistnthepank: its brewed by hysteria brewing co. out of columbia, md
[2019-02-23 23:48:03 UTC] skweakz: This game will be worth buying in like a year prob when they add more shit
[2019-02-23 23:48:05 UTC] stjosephsmith: same same, but ddifferent. Different but still same
[2019-02-23 23:48:06 UTC] dragonofwolves: Well story wise Towelliee is spot on. The story is similar to Mass Effect, you gotta go back and forth between talking to people. Thats just how Bioware does its game
[2019-02-23 23:48:21 UTC] lithium364: tomorrow darkshore up on eu horde
[2019-02-23 23:48:28 UTC] skweakz: The division 2 looks rly good if u want a shooter looter
[2019-02-23 23:48:54 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @skweakz lul
[2019-02-23 23:49:25 UTC] callmeclutch40: Yeah im debating between anthem and division but i feel anthem has alot more potential

[2019-02-23 23:49:49 UTC] skweakz: @gutterkhaoz LUL
[2019-02-23 23:49:51 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @skweakz only took them a whole other game release to get it right!
[2019-02-23 23:49:55 UTC] geauxgetta504: It's good time to be a looter shooter fan !

[2019-02-23 23:50:20 UTC] sketchsquadttv: then m+
[2019-02-23 23:50:28 UTC] sketchsquadttv: is there a m= chapionship??
[2019-02-23 23:50:32 UTC] skweakz: The first one was actually pretty good for what it was, and they added a lot to it
[2019-02-23 23:50:35 UTC] mett7: yeah its just Division 1 dlc
[2019-02-23 23:50:39 UTC] sketchsquadttv: for m+ @towelliee ?
[2019-02-23 23:50:41 UTC] jancorasputon: @Towelliee if you liked the last few patches of the first game you will like the 2nd one
[2019-02-23 23:50:42 UTC] cross_contour: its almost exactly like 1 with worse pvp and its abit boring tbh
[2019-02-23 23:50:43 UTC] skweakz: Not many games get it “right” at release anyway
[2019-02-23 23:50:45 UTC] kappamerc: D2 is really cool, I love the way the world is seamless, dungeons just load as u walk into the area.
[2019-02-23 23:50:48 UTC] mackesweden: its part one without snow
[2019-02-23 23:50:51 UTC] mize15: Is there raids? Or is that what strongholds are?
[2019-02-23 23:50:51 UTC] gopnikmedic: after wildlands, i'll never trust ubisoft for another sandbox shooter again
[2019-02-23 23:50:53 UTC] dilemma121: Towelliee you're the shit man! I love watching your game play you're fucking original.. I remember when you first started out playing wow. you're amazing man keep up the weight loss man you look great
[2019-02-23 23:50:54 UTC] callmeclutch40: Basically is the same just better features
[2019-02-23 23:51:03 UTC] gopnikmedic: I certainly dont ever trust Ubisoft
[2019-02-23 23:51:05 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @skweakz yeah it was a good game a year later after it was released
[2019-02-23 23:51:12 UTC] skweakz: Anthem took them 8 years and there isn’t shit to do besides a 5hr story quest
[2019-02-23 23:51:23 UTC] carnagexxiii: Wow has been out for 155 and they can't get launches perfect yet lol
[2019-02-23 23:51:28 UTC] asgoodasai3: @towelliee god this game is amazing got yesterday, started to play it when i was high af long story short salvage is not looting... all my pre order weps gone
[2019-02-23 23:51:31 UTC] cross_contour: Well the beta was a mess for division 2 so not sure about that
[2019-02-23 23:51:42 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @skweakz it’s pretty much just like Destiny was when the released TTK
[2019-02-23 23:51:45 UTC] skweakz: D1 was good on release as long as you had friends to Plath with....at least imo I had a rly good time on it
[2019-02-23 23:51:47 UTC] schluky: its 10 atleast
[2019-02-23 23:51:48 UTC] kappamerc: THe conversations were great
[2019-02-23 23:51:52 UTC] mett7: its not 6, actuall game prodaction was less then 6
[2019-02-23 23:52:06 UTC] seantorious: Anthem took six years @sKweakZ but that still doesn't excuse them for this story and releasing the game at this state.
[2019-02-23 23:52:18 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @skweakz the release was horrendous even with friends
[2019-02-23 23:52:33 UTC] babybabycow: @towelliee why the fuck do people not take a game for what it is. no one enjoys anything nowadays. The gameplay of anthem is absolutely perfect, but do you see people saying it? no, you see people saying how theres no endgame. SNORE
[2019-02-23 23:52:33 UTC] jflynn4251: What did?
[2019-02-23 23:52:35 UTC] noobishkamper: When division one first came out people complained that there was no end game. Then when they got it, it was too hard
[2019-02-23 23:52:38 UTC] skweakz: Idk I had almost 0 problems
[2019-02-23 23:52:39 UTC] harvtv: wildstar may have been good but it just looked corny to me for some reason
[2019-02-23 23:52:40 UTC] essadis: :(
[2019-02-23 23:52:43 UTC] aethn: Its been purchased so it is coming back
[2019-02-23 23:52:54 UTC] at1c: By whom?
[2019-02-23 23:52:58 UTC] fynryr: RIP WIldstar D=
[2019-02-23 23:53:05 UTC] fynryr: I'll always miss that game
[2019-02-23 23:53:07 UTC] aethn: The company that made Diablo Immortal bought Wildstar
[2019-02-23 23:53:09 UTC] sketchsquadttv: wows shutting down??
[2019-02-23 23:53:10 UTC] mett7: Wildstar was ok, too bad people dont care FeelsBadMan

[2019-02-23 23:53:27 UTC] budman269: lol
[2019-02-23 23:53:29 UTC] seantorious: Wait, so you enjoy the story @Towelliee ???
[2019-02-23 23:53:29 UTC] sketchsquadttv: oh anthem
[2019-02-23 23:53:30 UTC] thefresh_: ..
[2019-02-23 23:53:35 UTC] schluky: ye im surprised ppl dont praise the gameplay, its really good with the flying and combo system
[2019-02-23 23:53:36 UTC] skweakz: @babybabycow the game play of 0 content is amazing you are right
[2019-02-23 23:53:43 UTC] aeylid: Did you play mass effect?
[2019-02-23 23:53:46 UTC] bennodkk: Same feeling i have for season 9 of The walking dead
[2019-02-23 23:53:46 UTC] bluntrontv: Maybe Ill play for the story
[2019-02-23 23:53:53 UTC] jflynn4251: Owen?
[2019-02-23 23:54:06 UTC] callmeclutch40: Well according to EA they have more stuff coming but my concern is them not meeting sales and canceling and not getting what i paid for
[2019-02-23 23:54:13 UTC] seantorious: To each their own, I just know this isn't BioWare who made this game's story. They're a shell of who they were and it's sad.
[2019-02-23 23:54:15 UTC] babybabycow: @skweakZ dont buy the game if all you're going to do is complain, get a life, or wait for the fucking content to come out.
[2019-02-23 23:54:17 UTC] dingpong22: dont burst titties i like those
[2019-02-23 23:54:21 UTC] goryoun: @babybabycow because the HATE gives views and likes nowdays... See Apex for instance, if they had announced it, the game would be dead on arrival...
[2019-02-23 23:54:22 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @skweakz Anthem is 10x better than Division ever was
[2019-02-23 23:54:35 UTC] sketchsquadttv: towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[2019-02-23 23:54:37 UTC] dragonofwolves: I mean, Anthem will still be supported I'm sure of it. Any game that has a solid community will still play that game and it'll still be supported.
[2019-02-23 23:54:38 UTC] dingpong22: im addicted to anthem right now
[2019-02-23 23:54:45 UTC] skweakz: @babybabycow ya I’ll buy a game then wait a year for the content LUL
[2019-02-23 23:54:54 UTC] lycansheart: burn em with fire!
[2019-02-23 23:54:57 UTC] jericco8: @babybabycow looter shooter are all about the endgame grind and anthem needs more endgame content,but yeah gameplay is great
[2019-02-23 23:54:58 UTC] notoriuus: anthem is so bad lmao
[2019-02-23 23:55:05 UTC] mett7: LUL
[2019-02-23 23:55:10 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @notoriuus how so?
[2019-02-23 23:55:11 UTC] babybabycow: @skweakZ maybe if you actually read the content updates, but theres literally updates every month. kk kiddo
[2019-02-23 23:55:24 UTC] seantorious: Six months won't change the initial story but maybe it can be better in a few months and everything but it's definitely not a day one purchase.
[2019-02-23 23:55:28 UTC] gutterkhaoz: @babybabycow exactly
[2019-02-23 23:55:30 UTC] skweakz: Why are you so salty lol
[2019-02-23 23:55:38 UTC] notoriuus: @gutterkhaoz this game will be dead in 2 months trust me, bad game
[2019-02-23 23:55:49 UTC] skweakz: Calling people kids and kiddo online LUL basement warrior
[2019-02-23 23:56:01 UTC] at1c: Story is great, gameplay is great, just need some tweeeking on gear and loot drops

[2019-02-23 23:57:09 UTC] seantorious: I mean, yeah, lacking content
[2019-02-23 23:57:11 UTC] dhevoni: What this game needs is Loot 2.0, endgame is just so sad when you roll so many useless stats

[2019-02-23 23:57:46 UTC] schluky: is this gm2?
[2019-02-23 23:57:47 UTC] sketchsquadttv: GET SOME!!!

[2019-02-23 23:58:18 UTC] cowboysandpaladins: so is this game worth buying?

[2019-02-23 23:59:21 UTC] ka5h3d: @Notoriuus if you worked on it why are you badmouthing it? If you got fired, maybe you're not the best judge of the game if you're salty about the company you used to be employed at?
