[2019-02-24 21:56:03 UTC] knarral: There is clearly blame to be placed, this may have been an accident, but given we don't have literally any details it's not really possible to say who did what

[2019-02-24 21:56:19 UTC] pumpnineteen: that's my point

[2019-02-24 21:57:16 UTC] knarral: You'd be surprised how often people shoot themselves in cases of accidental discharge

[2019-02-24 21:58:57 UTC] lykrir: maybe he accidentally shot the wife but he still shot the wife
[2019-02-24 21:59:10 UTC] lykrir: thats why they usually say "reports say" or "allegedly"
[2019-02-24 21:59:21 UTC] knarral: We don't even know the policeman actually shot his wife
[2019-02-24 21:59:29 UTC] pumpnineteen: I still prefer the passive voice
[2019-02-24 21:59:30 UTC] knarral: Like I said, she may have accidentally shot herself
[2019-02-24 21:59:45 UTC] pumpnineteen: because that one implies the least intent
[2019-02-24 21:59:51 UTC] knarral: If they were "wrestling for the gun" it's possible the wife was the one with the finger on the trigger
[2019-02-24 22:00:27 UTC] knarral: We don't know what happened so saying definitively "the cop shot his wife" is a stupid move.
[2019-02-24 22:00:51 UTC] lykrir: Im sure it was a big accident
[2019-02-24 22:00:54 UTC] knarral: Either way, I'm sure there will be a divorce in their immediate future
[2019-02-24 22:01:03 UTC] lykrir: american cops always have big accidents
[2019-02-24 22:01:09 UTC] lykrir: so u gotta be really carfeul what you say
[2019-02-24 22:01:10 UTC] knarral: Somebody clearly went for the gun in the first place, we don't know who it was
[2019-02-24 22:01:47 UTC] brassraven: could've also been a drug bust
[2019-02-24 22:01:57 UTC] knarral: And I'm not in favor of demonizing police officers without any actual understanding of what happened.
[2019-02-24 22:01:58 UTC] lykrir: couldve been the imperio curse
[2019-02-24 22:02:01 UTC] brassraven: "wife was found covered in cocaine"
[2019-02-24 22:02:12 UTC] pumpnineteen: I aggre lyko that american cops shouldn't shoot so much, but also if a cop says freeze, u better fukin freeze
[2019-02-24 22:02:23 UTC] lykrir: what if youre black
[2019-02-24 22:02:29 UTC] lykrir: then u get shot in the back either way
[2019-02-24 22:02:32 UTC] pumpnineteen: I don't understand this 'I gonna stand up to this guy with the gun' attitude
[2019-02-24 22:02:56 UTC] pumpnineteen: there is 99% a confrontation or running away
[2019-02-24 22:03:04 UTC] pumpnineteen: just... don't
[2019-02-24 22:04:02 UTC] pumpnineteen: like that fat dude who got choked out... why the fuk is he mouthing with the officer
[2019-02-24 22:04:28 UTC] pumpnineteen: you can always do something later, when you are not ded
[2019-02-24 22:04:51 UTC] lykrir: but sometimes you are ded anyway
[2019-02-24 22:05:02 UTC] pumpnineteen: that is superduper rare actually
[2019-02-24 22:05:23 UTC] lykrir: im gonna watch animu about a farm where they murder chidlren for meat thats less depressing than thinkign about america
[2019-02-24 22:05:25 UTC] knarral: Whether or not you are dead depends on your actions, if you don't make the cop shoot then the vast majority of the time the cop isn't even going to draw.
[2019-02-24 22:05:44 UTC] pumpnineteen: :>
[2019-02-24 22:05:55 UTC] knarral: Cops shoot for the most part because, surprisingly, they don't actually want to die.
[2019-02-24 22:06:24 UTC] pumpnineteen: I'm just saying that every cop shooting video I saw, there was resisting arrest happening
[2019-02-24 22:06:32 UTC] lykrir: or because they can get away with killing innocent black ppl even when its beign recorded cos nobody cares
[2019-02-24 22:06:36 UTC] pumpnineteen: even if it was a bad shooting
[2019-02-24 22:06:40 UTC] pumpnineteen: it was avoidable
[2019-02-24 22:06:46 UTC] pumpnineteen: from the victim
[2019-02-24 22:06:55 UTC] knarral: That's such a ridiculous sentiment I'm not even going to consider your argument, Lykrir.
[2019-02-24 22:07:03 UTC] lykrir: xD k
[2019-02-24 22:07:55 UTC] pumpnineteen: lyko, there are bad shootings, but almost all of them are a result of confrontation
[2019-02-24 22:08:15 UTC] pumpnineteen: the 1 exception maybe where that kid had the BB gun at the playground
[2019-02-24 22:08:19 UTC] lykrir: somehow only happens in america tho
[2019-02-24 22:08:24 UTC] knarral: Not even
[2019-02-24 22:08:29 UTC] lykrir: and only with black ppl
[2019-02-24 22:08:31 UTC] pumpnineteen: but I haven't seen bodycam of that
[2019-02-24 22:08:31 UTC] knarral: The BB gun looked like an actual gun
[2019-02-24 22:08:35 UTC] lykrir: here the police doesnt ever shoot anyone
[2019-02-24 22:08:43 UTC] knarral: Lykrir, more white people are shot by police than black people
[2019-02-24 22:08:51 UTC] knarral: In America
[2019-02-24 22:09:02 UTC] brassraven: I heard that too
[2019-02-24 22:09:05 UTC] lykrir: well theres more white than black ppl in america
[2019-02-24 22:09:14 UTC] brassraven: also true
[2019-02-24 22:09:16 UTC] knarral: Yes, and?
[2019-02-24 22:09:17 UTC] pumpnineteen: Lykrir we had a police shootering last week here :D
[2019-02-24 22:09:18 UTC] lykrir: and im talking about the fucking traffic inspections where a black teen ends up dead
[2019-02-24 22:09:22 UTC] brassraven: there are also more guns in US than in germany
[2019-02-24 22:09:35 UTC] knarral: You realize how many times those black teens end up being gang bangers, right?
[2019-02-24 22:09:43 UTC] pumpnineteen: that's superduperduper rare lyko
[2019-02-24 22:09:47 UTC] knarral: They are very often repeat offenders.
[2019-02-24 22:09:53 UTC] brassraven: which is why police in germany don't have to go into a situation expecting a possible gun
[2019-02-24 22:10:11 UTC] lykrir: thats why america is such a depressing country
[2019-02-24 22:10:16 UTC] knarral: They are very often violent thugs with histories of murder, rape, or other violent crime.
[2019-02-24 22:10:36 UTC] brassraven: but in many rough neighbourhoods, you are very much afraid of guns everywhere
[2019-02-24 22:10:43 UTC] knarral: I would disagree that America is depressing.
[2019-02-24 22:11:00 UTC] lykrir: Well thats lucky cos you live there not me
[2019-02-24 22:11:04 UTC] lykrir: so we're all winners here
[2019-02-24 22:11:05 UTC] pumpnineteen: most of the world is depressing these days actually
[2019-02-24 22:11:20 UTC] pumpnineteen: stupid leaders everywhere
[2019-02-24 22:11:34 UTC] lykrir: i heard sweden is good when you were shot underground and need medical treatment Kappa
[2019-02-24 22:11:59 UTC] arkjz: yeah
[2019-02-24 22:12:09 UTC] brassraven: thankfully the chinese are perfecting the eugenics, so in the future we can all be perfect, 3m tall and chinese
[2019-02-24 22:12:19 UTC] lykrir: ill move to sweden i love ikea and meatballs and blonde people
[2019-02-24 22:12:22 UTC] arkjz: I usually go underground to get shot and then get medical treatment
[2019-02-24 22:12:36 UTC] lykrir: all for free? :o
[2019-02-24 22:12:48 UTC] knarral: If you're scared of living around people who might shoot you, you are very free to move somewhere else.
[2019-02-24 22:13:07 UTC] arkjz: a regular visit is 10 e but I dunno it should be free if it's an emergency
[2019-02-24 22:13:10 UTC] lykrir: we all do live somewhere else but thanks for the offer
[2019-02-24 22:13:12 UTC] brassraven: or get a bigger gun
[2019-02-24 22:13:22 UTC] lykrir: or get 2 bigger guns
[2019-02-24 22:13:28 UTC] brassraven: yes!
[2019-02-24 22:13:35 UTC] lykrir: at walmart
[2019-02-24 22:13:41 UTC] lykrir: they might have a buy 2 get one free offer
[2019-02-24 22:13:52 UTC] knarral: So many people refuse to acknowledge that America is a very, very large place and you can get land in rural areas very cheaply and there's always work you can do in the more rural areas so long as you can figure out where the hole in the market is.
[2019-02-24 22:14:33 UTC] brassraven: https://youtu.be/PkzFMfCamdU?t=34 always ends well
[2019-02-24 22:14:51 UTC] lykrir: :D
[2019-02-24 22:14:52 UTC] arkjz: I remember that one LUL
[2019-02-24 22:15:41 UTC] lykrir: hammer > gun
[2019-02-24 22:16:21 UTC] knarral: I own 3 guns, actually. People have this idea that just anybody can get any gun in America (which I would prefer to be the case, actually), but it's just not true, the background checks are just done with computers and databases so it happens near instantly. If you have a felony, drug offense, or other violent crime on record, you cannot legally purchase a firearm anywhere in the US.
[2019-02-24 22:16:40 UTC] lykrir: ok
[2019-02-24 22:17:30 UTC] knarral: And any law abiding gun store in the US will refuse to sell you the firearm immediately after running your background check and finding out that you're not allowed to purchase one, and that happens within 5 minutes or so of starting the process.
[2019-02-24 22:17:32 UTC] brassraven: but you don't have to be a criminal mastermind to have a friend buy you a gun
[2019-02-24 22:17:49 UTC] knarral: That's true, too.
[2019-02-24 22:18:22 UTC] lykrir: its a fail proof system really
[2019-02-24 22:18:25 UTC] lykrir: https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1823016659
[2019-02-24 22:18:39 UTC] knarral: But there is no realistic way to prevent that from happening other than holding the friend liable if he knew that he wasn't going to be able to legally purchase the firearm.
[2019-02-24 22:18:43 UTC] brassraven: :D
[2019-02-24 22:18:44 UTC] arkjz: https://youtu.be/WBMcoJWo92Y?t=496 my life in a nutshell
[2019-02-24 22:19:28 UTC] lykrir: oh no ark :(
[2019-02-24 22:19:32 UTC] arkjz: :(
[2019-02-24 22:19:49 UTC] lykrir: its ok we'll find you a husband before 30
[2019-02-24 22:20:01 UTC] arkjz: will you get me out of the dinosaur park?
[2019-02-24 22:20:13 UTC] brassraven: can't be done
[2019-02-24 22:20:33 UTC] arkjz: :(
[2019-02-24 22:20:53 UTC] lykrir: dont listen to brass hes always so negativew
[2019-02-24 22:21:03 UTC] arkjz: thank you
[2019-02-24 22:21:48 UTC] brassraven: the technology just isn't there yet
[2019-02-24 22:22:01 UTC] knarral: Unless you want to take the stance that you can only purchase firearms from gun stores and not from anywhere else, but there is absolutely no way to enforce that whatsoever since there's no way to know whether or not you did purchase it from a gun store unless you want to implement a national gun registry which will never pass because literally every single time one has been implemented in any country it has been almost immediately followed by a government gun grab and gun owners in America are
[2019-02-24 22:22:25 UTC] lykrir: wow brass thats harsh
[2019-02-24 22:22:36 UTC] lykrir: its ok ark he didnt mean to imply you can only date robots
[2019-02-24 22:22:46 UTC] lykrir: we'll find a real life human bean for you just you wait :)
[2019-02-24 22:23:01 UTC] arkjz: :)
[2019-02-24 22:25:46 UTC] knarral: And even then you couldn't realistically get all of the ~450 million firearms in a registry anyway so it wouldn't work regardless.
[2019-02-24 22:27:25 UTC] arkjz: well im gonna read my book before i go to sleep good night
[2019-02-24 22:27:51 UTC] lykrir: ill animu and slep too
