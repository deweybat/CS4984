[2019-02-23 00:43:12 UTC] the_mvrck: @Day9tv Things do respawn over time, but it takes a bit, and you constantly need new materials so it does push you to explore new areas

[2019-02-23 15:23:22 UTC] arkjz: if a monkey took your phone and challenged you to a poo flinging contest
[2019-02-23 15:23:28 UTC] arkjz: first to hit the other in the face gets the phone
[2019-02-23 15:23:36 UTC] arkjz: would you take the challenge or let the monkey keep the phone?
[2019-02-23 15:24:25 UTC] brassraven: I would let him keep the phone, call animal services and repeat harambe incident
[2019-02-23 15:24:54 UTC] arkjz: yeah but he's not in a zoo and also you can't call anyone because he has your phone
[2019-02-23 15:24:58 UTC] arkjz: then he'll call human services
[2019-02-23 15:25:16 UTC] brassraven: 🤔
[2019-02-23 15:25:44 UTC] brassraven: I think I could win this contest, because humans are better throwers
[2019-02-23 15:26:48 UTC] arkjz: yes that is the correct answer!!!
[2019-02-23 15:26:54 UTC] arkjz: but you would get poop on your hands but thats okay
[2019-02-23 15:27:30 UTC] arkjz: not many animals are good throwers and humans are the best B) monkeys are decent but not close to us
[2019-02-23 15:29:01 UTC] brassraven: then again monkeys are crafty little buggers
[2019-02-23 15:29:58 UTC] arkjz: chimpanzees and baboons are scury
