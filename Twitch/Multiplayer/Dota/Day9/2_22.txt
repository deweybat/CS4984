[2019-02-22 03:45:19 UTC] ghoststalker_88: Grim as it might sound. I wonder how much blood is actually capable of leaving the average human body. It seems that there is a lot of variance in media
[2019-02-22 03:45:53 UTC] mogsy_: a minkey?!
[2019-02-22 03:45:58 UTC] marlowe19: @ghoststalker_88 it also seems heavily dependent on the manner in which the blood is leaving
[2019-02-22 03:46:03 UTC] iamtheshazz: a mankey? the pokemon?
[2019-02-22 03:46:14 UTC] khufu77: This game reminds me of that first person rpg that came out a few years ago.... with the sorceror stuck in the book?

[2019-02-22 03:48:27 UTC] sc2janitor: Yeah @ghoststalker_88 it depends on how the blood is leaving. You won’t completely bleed dry on your own. Your body will shutdown before it loses all its blood from a wound

[2019-02-22 04:12:02 UTC] mrjackart: @funwithleigh then yeah using blurred brushes in photoshop while in a bitmap image will get you at least some of that effect
[2019-02-22 04:12:10 UTC] kohuda: Crabs can't even swim, how'd they get on the ship
[2019-02-22 04:12:16 UTC] mrjackart: not sure how easily controlled it is though

[2019-02-22 04:14:26 UTC] mrjackart: yeah, you have to convert a greyscale image to bitmap. low opacity ' blurred brushes set to dissolve will give you that effect.
[2019-02-22 04:14:31 UTC] ang8811: giant enemy crabs :(
[2019-02-22 04:14:32 UTC] sichayta: how did it get into that part of the ship?

[2019-02-22 04:14:42 UTC] mrjackart: though now that I'm looking at it just using the 'dissolve' option on your brush will do the same thing
[2019-02-22 04:15:00 UTC] mrjackart: you just have to make sure you're not at too high a resolution otherwise the pixels are too fine

[2019-02-22 04:15:22 UTC] denunciator: hour

[2019-02-22 04:15:49 UTC] mrjackart: but it does restrict you from using a bunch of filters and other effects

[2019-02-22 04:18:13 UTC] crogacht: Yes, they were.

[2019-02-22 04:20:54 UTC] canadianbac0nz: what if that crab is actually really small and everyone on the ship has been shrunken down by the curse of the kraken 🤔
[2019-02-22 04:21:02 UTC] marlowe19: All sizes of crabs have their dangers. Quite a few of them go great with butter.

[2019-02-22 04:21:24 UTC] mrjackart: @Marlowe19 that's more dangerous to the crab than the human, I think...
[2019-02-22 04:21:47 UTC] kohuda: We gotta find the name of the crab?
[2019-02-22 04:22:00 UTC] purified100: @canadianbac0nz the entire game actually takes place on a lil' ship in a bottle

[2019-02-22 04:23:08 UTC] kohuda: They're probably super hungry and trying to boil the crab.
[2019-02-22 04:23:15 UTC] mrjackart: so is that the crab that killed them, or the guy who exploded the crab?

It's really crazy how much information there out there and it is now no wonder to me why people specialize in it.

[2019-02-22 21:57:36 UTC] scourgerland: A stratagem is a scheme or a clever plot. You can have a stratagem for winning a chess game, getting the girl (or boy), and avoiding a punishment. However, your opponents, crushes, and parents may have a trick or two of their own.

[2019-02-22 23:27:20 UTC] unicornjam: but more advanced

[2019-02-22 23:37:22 UTC] cassandra112: specific locations, but respawn, and some rng on certain items
[2019-02-22 23:37:23 UTC] chunkyspaceman: procedural, respawn in an area over time
[2019-02-22 23:37:24 UTC] venfayth: it's procedurally hand made

[2019-02-22 23:37:32 UTC] moddington: @Day9tv resources and fragments are procedural and do not respawn

[2019-02-22 23:37:39 UTC] subssanssoda: little things respawn

[2019-02-22 23:37:44 UTC] spiffersthegrand: The resource locations are procedurally replaced. The map is hand constructed
[2019-02-22 23:37:47 UTC] jotatoe: Im pretty sure they spawn in that same region, but not exact same spot
[2019-02-22 23:37:49 UTC] blaisoffire: @Day9tv You will never run out Don't worry about it, like seriously
[2019-02-22 23:37:49 UTC] haldin: If it's procedural, it's... consistent.
[2019-02-22 23:37:56 UTC] ascorgames: Artisanally placed.
[2019-02-22 23:38:01 UTC] fun_on_a_bun010: i believe resources have spawn locations but they spawn in randomly

[2019-02-22 23:39:33 UTC] fieldmedic4077: rawr rooREE
[2019-02-22 23:39:35 UTC] lambchaikies: Is there some standardized vocabulary or tier-system for "levels" of backseating? like actual backseating is "Do X/Y/Z.", but adages are like "Stay Organized.", tips are lower at "Kill The Dogs First.", mechanical explanations "Dying drops unsaved materials.", reminders "You've found Copper in Limestone before.", or meta Controls/Input/HUD info? Obviously a streamer can simply say "No spoilers unless I explicitly ask for X." but it's mostly fuzzy territory.
[2019-02-22 23:39:37 UTC] exezelot: I loved figuring out all this out
[2019-02-22 23:39:38 UTC] biohazard011: @Day9tv I see that motion sickness did not stop you from subnautica. Nice :D

[2019-02-22 23:39:47 UTC] kharadbanar: @denunciator The lack of a map is absolutely intentional in this game.

[2019-02-22 23:41:38 UTC] bloodstar23: When you play this in VR you use a controller and are seated, so motion sickness isn't really very bad.
[2019-02-22 23:41:38 UTC] ascorgames: Would that really make the situation worse tho?
[2019-02-22 23:41:41 UTC] subssanssoda: i've never had it happen on the surface. is that reassuring @Day9tv ?
[2019-02-22 23:41:42 UTC] fieldmedic4077: lol possibly later cohhLUL

[2019-02-22 23:42:00 UTC] chunkyspaceman: they respawn in the same biome
[2019-02-22 23:42:09 UTC] jumpflash: The misinformation in this chat is staggering
[2019-02-22 23:42:11 UTC] vwemm: sandybois
[2019-02-22 23:42:12 UTC] bloodstar23: Unless they changed it since release nothing respawns...
[2019-02-22 23:42:13 UTC] lunar688: do they? they didn't respawn for me near the pod..
[2019-02-22 23:42:15 UTC] ang8811: yeah this pressurization and de-pressurization would be doing a number on your internal orgons with how much you're flying around these depths
[2019-02-22 23:42:19 UTC] denunciator: @jumpflash it's part of the dayRope experience

[2019-02-22 23:42:29 UTC] unicornjam: another question is how is he storing all this material
[2019-02-22 23:42:35 UTC] the_mvrck: Oh man, Subnautica?!
[2019-02-22 23:42:35 UTC] unicornjam: and not drowning
[2019-02-22 23:42:37 UTC] banksy_collective: doesn't really want but is still gonna collect all of it
[2019-02-22 23:42:38 UTC] bloodstar23: There's actually a text file in the game files that maps all of the nodes you've ever collected and prevents them from ever respawning unless you delete it.
[2019-02-22 23:42:46 UTC] bubblebooy: When you build a scanned you can clear areas. so the must not respawn
[2019-02-22 23:42:46 UTC] vwemm: If we throw enough misinformation at him, it'll be impossible to distinguish the actual spoilers Kappa
[2019-02-22 23:42:47 UTC] aperprose: @unicornjam He's got big pockets

[2019-02-22 23:42:59 UTC] 1opinionated: @Lambchaikies Try to avoid tips that specify something he hasn't discovered yet, like a blueprint or creature. At that point, you're into spoiler territory.
[2019-02-22 23:43:20 UTC] denunciator: i have a question, does "git gud" count as something he hasn't discovered Kappa
[2019-02-22 23:43:21 UTC] nuclearfish123: i love that he missed the one thing he was going to need from the pod dayRope

[2019-02-22 23:43:29 UTC] exezelot: Or where something spawns or is found. Exploration is the whole game, so it really is a spoiler
[2019-02-22 23:43:29 UTC] aperprose: to answer how he is storing all the metal

[2019-02-22 23:43:53 UTC] danplantain: didn't he get a compass from that other pod?
[2019-02-22 23:44:03 UTC] exezelot: He got blueprints to make it

[2019-02-22 23:44:22 UTC] exezelot: It’s the cycle of the game. Go out, find blueprints, craft them, go back out
[2019-02-22 23:44:25 UTC] unit_42: @exezelot Ah thanks. That explains it!
[2019-02-22 23:44:38 UTC] lunar688: love the sound track in this game. Wish it was more frequent. I ended up playing the soundtrack on spotify while i played

[2019-02-22 23:45:17 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Day9tv I would recommend exploring further before deciding where you build your base

[2019-02-22 23:46:56 UTC] subssanssoda: you need to construct additional pylons, i mean a base

[2019-02-22 23:47:32 UTC] ag_blues: You can build a simple corridor and put a hatch on it and that can work as a rudimentary base where you can build lockers.
