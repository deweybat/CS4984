[2019-02-27 03:06:17 UTC] denunciator: on paper it's good vs control because you target their lands, they draw sorcs that they can't really play. but it's just an EDH card, it's completely unviable in constructed since it dies to removal

[2019-02-27 20:42:09 UTC] theburningsoda: good
[2019-02-27 20:42:13 UTC] theburningsoda: pump how does autotune work
[2019-02-27 20:42:35 UTC] pumpnineteen: with a microphone and an audio processor soder
[2019-02-27 20:42:51 UTC] theburningsoda: yes but
[2019-02-27 20:42:53 UTC] lykrir: i hate autotune
[2019-02-27 20:42:54 UTC] theburningsoda: What does it do
[2019-02-27 20:43:00 UTC] theburningsoda: To the sound?
[2019-02-27 20:43:11 UTC] lykrir: makes it robot
[2019-02-27 20:43:59 UTC] pumpnineteen: it finds the closest or preprogrammed target sounds and modulates the pitch of the incomming sound
[2019-02-27 20:44:13 UTC] pumpnineteen: the rest is just effects added to it
[2019-02-27 20:44:53 UTC] theburningsoda: and these target sounds are "good" to listen to?
[2019-02-27 20:45:21 UTC] pumpnineteen: they are the correct pitch, yes
[2019-02-27 20:45:50 UTC] theburningsoda: hmmm
[2019-02-27 20:46:05 UTC] pumpnineteen: in all musical systems the sounds have set Hz values
[2019-02-27 20:46:22 UTC] pumpnineteen: u can add effects to those, like vibrato and stuff
[2019-02-27 20:46:44 UTC] pumpnineteen: but an A should always be 467Hz or something
[2019-02-27 20:47:04 UTC] lykrir: but youll still sound like youre having a shower in a tin can
[2019-02-27 20:47:09 UTC] theburningsoda: So if people are bad at singing A, autotune makes their voice do an A?
[2019-02-27 20:47:09 UTC] pumpnineteen: sry it's 440
[2019-02-27 20:47:17 UTC] pumpnineteen: yis
[2019-02-27 20:48:21 UTC] theburningsoda: hmmm
[2019-02-27 20:48:31 UTC] theburningsoda: there are too many things i dont know about sound
[2019-02-27 20:48:57 UTC] theburningsoda: What other properties does my voice have, other than frequency?
[2019-02-27 20:49:22 UTC] pumpnineteen: it's weird cuz if you deviate slightly from the set Hz, it sounds bad/off pitch, yet eg in vibrato u dance around the note
[2019-02-27 20:49:30 UTC] pumpnineteen: well
[2019-02-27 20:50:02 UTC] pumpnineteen: u heff harmonics too, if you are playing an instrument
[2019-02-27 20:50:46 UTC] pumpnineteen: if you do a sound it's not a perfict 1 note sine wave
[2019-02-27 20:50:59 UTC] pumpnineteen: and the wave pattern is important
[2019-02-27 20:51:10 UTC] pumpnineteen: that's hao u can differentiate instruments and things
[2019-02-27 20:51:32 UTC] theburningsoda: /me takes notes
[2019-02-27 20:51:51 UTC] pumpnineteen: when you do stuff like skrillex, it's just very weird wave patterns

[2019-02-27 23:40:44 UTC] iamtheshazz: as someone who spams a lot of new drow, side lane drow is a FeelsBadMan
[2019-02-27 23:40:52 UTC] iamtheshazz: i only play her mid
[2019-02-27 23:41:34 UTC] iamtheshazz: you just snowball so hard with her it's insane
[2019-02-27 23:42:01 UTC] iamtheshazz: and then stuff like that happens, you're dead before your lvl 6 and you just get gimped
[2019-02-27 23:42:05 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: Frosty hug monkaS
[2019-02-27 23:42:23 UTC] iamtheshazz: if they just keep killing her now dire won't have a game
[2019-02-27 23:42:40 UTC] zyant: i hope that do something to the jungle that brings brood back into the meta. i miss her
[2019-02-27 23:43:02 UTC] excalibur_z: the thing is that she doesn't really *DO* anything in mid either. especially before level 6.
[2019-02-27 23:43:38 UTC] fanifia: yeah but being mid means she gets to 6 faster
[2019-02-27 23:43:46 UTC] iamtheshazz: that's true, but i've always played drow mid as just soak xp and don't die
[2019-02-27 23:44:10 UTC] iamtheshazz: i faerie so much regen to the lane just so i can keep soaking xp til 6
[2019-02-27 23:44:14 UTC] dhrenzen: purge is just power farming LUL
[2019-02-27 23:44:52 UTC] iamtheshazz: and then i just push jungle and hit ancients until i get my first power spike
[2019-02-27 23:45:04 UTC] iamtheshazz: which isn't too long, like maybe 4-5 minutes max after i hit 6
[2019-02-27 23:45:12 UTC] iamtheshazz: *push lane

[2019-02-27 23:45:47 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: That succ was unwise LUL
[2019-02-27 23:46:01 UTC] iamtheshazz: i can't help but feel like this drow is not a drow player
[2019-02-27 23:46:02 UTC] excalibur_z: mid is generally where you want your most flexible playmaker and drow kind of limits you there. so it's almost like saccing your early mid momentum for a midgame boost
[2019-02-27 23:46:12 UTC] iamtheshazz: i'd be in the triangle
[2019-02-27 23:46:16 UTC] excalibur_z: this lion is not having a fun time
[2019-02-27 23:46:30 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: Plus sf sucks bad sidelane too
[2019-02-27 23:47:01 UTC] iamtheshazz: i mean yea, you're sort of sac-ing mid with having your drow there
[2019-02-27 23:47:07 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: slAmMiN Kreygasm
[2019-02-27 23:47:11 UTC] critter38: critroleBts
[2019-02-27 23:47:36 UTC] iamtheshazz: but she can get to her spike so much faster because of marksmanship that you just need a draft that doesn't get super steamrolled
[2019-02-27 23:48:18 UTC] excalibur_z: yeah you need really self-sustaining sidelanes to compensate
[2019-02-27 23:48:46 UTC] iamtheshazz: although even as a 1.4k player, i make a fair few share of rotations as a mid drow
[2019-02-27 23:49:02 UTC] fanifia: riki pickers LUL

[2019-02-27 23:50:23 UTC] fanifia: sean says he wants to play p4, but then he plays like a p3/p2 🤔
[2019-02-27 23:50:50 UTC] excalibur_z: hell, sometimes your p4 just goes 16-0-18. happens.
[2019-02-27 23:50:53 UTC] zyant: poverty 4s dont really work
[2019-02-27 23:52:13 UTC] kharadbanar: a poverty 4 is called a 5 Kappa
[2019-02-27 23:52:13 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: Double hug monkaS
[2019-02-27 23:53:12 UTC] fanifia: @Zyant not sure what you mean, p4 usually has these items ~20mins so hes a little quick because he does things like going bot and farming
[2019-02-27 23:53:34 UTC] zyant: yes, as 4 he should be in lanes without a carry to get the farm
[2019-02-27 23:53:36 UTC] fanifia: most p4 would leave open lanes for the p1/p2/p3 depending on the team comp
[2019-02-27 23:53:47 UTC] zyant: because the 4's job is typically to make plays
[2019-02-27 23:54:10 UTC] zyant: and u need items to do that
[2019-02-27 23:54:19 UTC] dhrenzen: RIP frames
[2019-02-27 23:54:33 UTC] fanifia: i feel like he should be top with the team in case a team fight breaks out. once they decide to back off, one of the other players will go down to bot
[2019-02-27 23:54:45 UTC] fanifia: they had 4 top dancing around high ground at the time
[2019-02-27 23:54:46 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: Earthshaker Kreygasm
[2019-02-27 23:55:35 UTC] zyant: well he is a ns, if its day time and his ult is down hes almost useless. getting farm and items counters that some
[2019-02-27 23:55:48 UTC] zyant: so better to be farming in that situation
[2019-02-27 23:55:48 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: Lmao that lion really likes overextending to secure mana drains LUL
[2019-02-27 23:56:40 UTC] fanifia: it was nighttime
