[2019-02-21 00:01:04 UTC] ang8811: y'all see the new galaxy fold? looks neat but jeeeeez $2000 for a phone is steep
[2019-02-21 00:01:05 UTC] cheeseyx: @Count_Brennuvarg We have no way to accurately assess the probabilities of various things, so there's not really any more to say about the issue besides "I think X is more likely"
[2019-02-21 00:01:08 UTC] count_brennuvarg: feels Ear Drums man
[2019-02-21 00:01:09 UTC] k9kroz: wooo
[2019-02-21 00:01:11 UTC] tanath_raal: all good!
[2019-02-21 00:01:15 UTC] mr_valdyr: Every time sean resets something changes, brightness or sound or both :P

[2019-02-21 00:02:13 UTC] knaught: The files are IN the computer!
[2019-02-21 00:02:21 UTC] irtehsuk: maybe your elgato is falty?
[2019-02-21 00:02:23 UTC] eran312: you have a pretty unique setup right ?
[2019-02-21 00:02:28 UTC] subssanssoda: it's the AI taking over!!
[2019-02-21 00:02:31 UTC] ninmuffin: @Day9tv have you contacted elgato support?
[2019-02-21 00:02:32 UTC] bacotaco: its kinda funny about thispersondoesnotexist, the website... many of the faces look like you're on a trip
[2019-02-21 00:02:33 UTC] fledgyapplehands: Inside... physically?
[2019-02-21 00:02:34 UTC] subssanssoda: it's the singularity!!
[2019-02-21 00:02:41 UTC] eran312: conversation went great
[2019-02-21 00:02:46 UTC] marlowe19: El gato is chasing an internal laser pointer?
[2019-02-21 00:03:02 UTC] bacotaco: wait why was sean in NYC? he had a stream right?
[2019-02-21 00:03:03 UTC] zeniph: So it is a Garbage Collector? Does it run on Java?
[2019-02-21 00:03:07 UTC] bacotaco: ws it for singleton weekend?
[2019-02-21 00:03:09 UTC] cheeseyx: @Count_Brennuvarg Yes, but we've been actively trying to achieve sustained nuclear fusion for decades and it's never happened. Just because we try doesn't mean it's actually coming soon
[2019-02-21 00:03:15 UTC] ninmuffin: could this also be a cat hair problem?
[2019-02-21 00:03:37 UTC] jovo: That pen is mesmerizing
[2019-02-21 00:03:41 UTC] tin_fox: I've thought about it. I'm a programmer, but not in that field. Made for one of my SDLs (we do Self-directed learning sessions every sprint at my company)
[2019-02-21 00:03:51 UTC] cgordini: hey @Day9tv I know you've used a few Samsung products -- what do you think of the Fold announced today?
[2019-02-21 00:04:00 UTC] sacriel: As much as I'd like to agree, I think we can all agree the most powerful hammer is Mjolnir
[2019-02-21 00:04:00 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Day9tv Ehhhhh, I think that we're a hell of a lot closer to strong general AI than you give credit to. It's something that could be possible and achievable within the next 20-40 years.
[2019-02-21 00:04:09 UTC] irtehsuk: Hey @Day9tv how is the programming going?
[2019-02-21 00:04:12 UTC] alkoipone: Hey @Day9tv watched you through youtube for years but today has been the first time I could ever sub/actually watch a stream. Look forward to watching more in the future and reading all the interesting convos in twitch chat. Anyway, I gotta get out of here so take my bits and catch ya'll later. cheer1000
[2019-02-21 00:04:14 UTC] marlowe19: AI can very easily render a perfect picture of a giraffe. It cannot, however, imagine a dragon
[2019-02-21 00:04:24 UTC] eran312: @Day9tv isn't there some possibility that AI develops in ways that are not predictable right now?
[2019-02-21 00:04:25 UTC] k9kroz: Like war..
[2019-02-21 00:04:31 UTC] fieldmedic4077: cohhBot things like take over the world
[2019-02-21 00:04:38 UTC] awakeandaware: I feel the cutoff point for Krasis being satisfying is exactly 6 mana.
[2019-02-21 00:04:51 UTC] dragyg: @Day9tv I read this amazing article about how the simplest AI being able to learn and evolve would evolve at an astronomical level very fast. I'd link it with permission but I cant find it anymore ;-;
[2019-02-21 00:04:55 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: I wonder if we'll ever have a computer that is powerful enough to give me a sense of purpose in life MrDestructoid
[2019-02-21 00:04:57 UTC] beermanman: AI attempt to satisfy it's heuristics. If art involves novel expression, there's no way to evaluate it's fitness (adherence to preset heuristics)
[2019-02-21 00:04:59 UTC] bacotaco: hey @Day9tv just so you know it brought me so much joy to see your beautiful face along danny trejo on my MTGA home screen dayJoy
[2019-02-21 00:05:05 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Day9tv Do you think that a reliance AI or automated computing in general is bad for humanity?
[2019-02-21 00:05:13 UTC] tin_fox: "We want you to train your replacement" (jk >.>)
[2019-02-21 00:05:29 UTC] valthoris: I had a feeling it was going to be another shitty Nexus deck...

[2019-02-21 00:06:14 UTC] marlowe19: There’s a whole futuristic philosophy field dedicated to imagining the future of AI and humanity
[2019-02-21 00:06:26 UTC] k9kroz: not over.. he hasnt presented a win con
[2019-02-21 00:06:36 UTC] dragyg: chess is another example
[2019-02-21 00:06:41 UTC] tin_fox: I'll still draw regardless - I mean there are TONS of people better at drawing than me already
[2019-02-21 00:06:44 UTC] subssanssoda: look at it this way: doing math in your head can impress people, but no one is impressed when a calculator does the same thing
[2019-02-21 00:06:46 UTC] dragyg: seeing alphazero play was incredible
[2019-02-21 00:06:50 UTC] eran312: its amazing how much advice you can give during a nexus game lmao
[2019-02-21 00:06:55 UTC] harrydoshay: omg can this can please play an actual card
[2019-02-21 00:07:05 UTC] typhoidrat: @Day9tv you should do a Brood War night with subs sometimes. Just jam a bunch of BGH
[2019-02-21 00:07:12 UTC] cheeseyx: Also, people will always put value in things that are hard to make. Even if we have AI that can make perfect paintings, people will still value stuff made by actual humans
[2019-02-21 00:07:13 UTC] ascorgames: >tfw all you need to do to fix a bug is increase an int value.
[2019-02-21 00:07:14 UTC] dragyg: @Day9tv have you watched the alphazero chess or go matches?
[2019-02-21 00:07:17 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: Just do your thing man VoHiYo
[2019-02-21 00:07:20 UTC] fledgyapplehands: Do you think that in order to make better ai we'll have to make it less accurate? Like how the cerebellum is like a biological neural network?
[2019-02-21 00:07:21 UTC] mr_valdyr: @Day9tv make him play his hand, i'm enjoying this conversation :p
[2019-02-21 00:07:25 UTC] liverflap: TAS Speedruns and RTA's still exist side by side. in many ways, TAS pushes the RTA community and vice versa
[2019-02-21 00:07:28 UTC] nisokr: He probably has depose//deploy as a wincon
[2019-02-21 00:07:43 UTC] cgordini: @Day9tv most of my amateur mechanic wrenching is just inviting some friends over where we can all half-ass my car together.

[2019-02-21 00:07:54 UTC] highwatergaming: @Day9tv any chance you'll check out Apex Legends?
[2019-02-21 00:07:54 UTC] averagegameguy: i feel like i need maybe a coloring book just to pass the time on these combo decks

[2019-02-21 00:08:05 UTC] valthoris: Nexus decks don't need a win con, they just need to take infinite turns doing nothing.

[2019-02-21 00:08:46 UTC] andrew_mclean: Yeah, if you can't interact with the game, at least you can interact with us
[2019-02-21 00:08:47 UTC] k9kroz: @Day9tv no need for the red lands now? or did i miss a card?
[2019-02-21 00:08:49 UTC] ninmuffin: I wish there was a way to add googly eyes to mtga, would make the game a 10/10
[2019-02-21 00:08:54 UTC] tofreeman: @Tin_Fox keep trying man, you never know :)
[2019-02-21 00:08:55 UTC] eran312: ye it was a pretty speedy sideboard looked sexy
[2019-02-21 00:09:07 UTC] gunny: I chat via my phone so it’s slower :(
[2019-02-21 00:09:23 UTC] tofreeman: @Tin_Fox I did and I enjoy every day
[2019-02-21 00:09:27 UTC] galdos92: why not cindervines instead of the brontodon ?
[2019-02-21 00:09:44 UTC] themagicalyak: The interaction of Chess and AI is interesting. AI has solved chess. Chess is still as fun for human vs human as it ever has been. Its just easier to go back and see where you messed up.

[2019-02-21 00:13:43 UTC] sacriel: what are your thoughts on the concept that, considering we've gone from pong to current gen VR in a matter of years, regardless of a slow down in progress (as you can just add more time) many people believe we are already in a lifelike simulation as it is conceivable that we could ourselves do it in 100, 1000, 10,000 years, it may have already happened and we are already in.

[2019-02-21 00:55:05 UTC] wizarddanceparty: I like Pokemon's energy system for mana.

[2019-02-21 00:55:08 UTC] superkamigurur: the other fun thing about the land system is that it affords the opportunity to have cool effects like cabal stronghold or fetch lands
[2019-02-21 00:55:13 UTC] uberdumplings: Is a frog lizard an amphibian or a reptile? Both or neither?
[2019-02-21 00:55:23 UTC] qeqeneq: the randomness adds to the excitement and narrative of each game, but it would need to reduce the variance and be more consistent for the overall playing experience to improve
[2019-02-21 00:55:23 UTC] tyrus_77: @darkwolf1186 looooove Keyforge
[2019-02-21 00:55:23 UTC] sillyham: Netunner is probably the best card game created.

[2019-02-21 00:55:38 UTC] nuggettou: @400lows exactly. even though there is variance within how you draw a deck, running draw and stuff like that can make up for it. The mana math article on Channel Fireball is excellent at making this clearer
[2019-02-21 00:55:40 UTC] cengaaver: I like Eternal's power/influence system a lot.

[2019-02-21 00:56:12 UTC] edgewren: games without resources systems (such as YuGiOh) generally have to scale down the power of their cards b/c there isn't any restriction in deck building. Plus couldn't play Omnath w/o lands
[2019-02-21 00:56:18 UTC] nuggettou: it is truly excellent
[2019-02-21 00:56:21 UTC] aaron2a: @day9tv being new to the game it appears that land gives an element of complexity that feels more satisfying to manipulate than if you generated it naturally
[2019-02-21 00:56:27 UTC] ang8811: yugioh? low power cards? uh
[2019-02-21 00:56:31 UTC] superkamigurur: plus you can make your lands 4/4 elementals. they are still a land
[2019-02-21 00:56:31 UTC] stephenjball: Actually the best economy system in a card game for me was Warhammer 40k: Conquest, where you had to strategically fight for your resources. Of course that's just another dead LCG.
[2019-02-21 00:56:54 UTC] bacotaco: seems like card draw is a big flaw of this deck

[2019-02-21 00:57:37 UTC] darkwolf1186: I just think magic really hits that combo of deckbuilding and strategic gameplay, and with Arena it feels so much easier to get in to. Draft and sealed until you're comfortable, you can even be full FTP and still eventually be competitive.

[2019-02-21 00:58:21 UTC] banksy_collective: honestly the pain of flood/screw might just be a confirmation bias of remembering the nongames because of land
[2019-02-21 00:58:33 UTC] nuggettou: @Violent_Enigma have you seen the chromatic black deck? its sweet, but expensive. The card on its own, im not sure
[2019-02-21 00:58:39 UTC] stephenjball: What pushed me away from actually playing MTG anymore myself was that I felt like losing often felt bad, and winning often didn't feel great either. Land being a major factor in that.
[2019-02-21 00:58:39 UTC] superkamigurur: @Violent_Enigma only if you play it in mono black with lich's mastery :P
[2019-02-21 00:58:42 UTC] t3dw4rd0: confirmation bias definitely contributes

[2019-02-21 01:07:10 UTC] nuggettou: @PhantomOfAres should have been clearer. i meant why did OP counter with the expensive spell
[2019-02-21 01:07:15 UTC] phantomofares: Oh, I see

[2019-02-21 01:07:26 UTC] phantomofares: Just gotta stop maximum damage, which is 3 in that case
[2019-02-21 01:07:40 UTC] phantomofares: You might save for whirler, I suppose, but that's pretty rare there
[2019-02-21 01:07:41 UTC] nuggettou: @PhantomOfAres like even if he sacs all 3 of his sirens he still had lethal i think

Some, though, are very common or would require too much space to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name of the ability as a "keyword"; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule. 702.2. Deathtouch 702.3. Defender 702.4. Double Strike 702.5.

[2019-02-21 02:27:10 UTC] slinkyshad0w: you have red spells. it wants you to cast red spells
[2019-02-21 02:27:10 UTC] merikh_cw: Auto tap definitely needs to be changed to tap non-unique lands first, then duals, then special
[2019-02-21 02:27:17 UTC] dkline9206: it did it because you have red spells in your hand
[2019-02-21 02:27:23 UTC] dkline9206: but it shoudl have asked permission if you ask me
[2019-02-21 02:27:26 UTC] aaron2a: @Day9tv it should be coded so that you could personally arrange your land from right to left to indicate the priority of land use
[2019-02-21 02:27:33 UTC] lunar688: chugging hard
[2019-02-21 02:27:34 UTC] kakefumi: chug?

[2019-02-21 02:28:03 UTC] aaron2a: @Day9tv i realize that that is a bigger ask than coding -> ? -> Better ui
[2019-02-21 02:28:14 UTC] averagegameguy: all better
[2019-02-21 02:28:18 UTC] marlowe19: Yes, if only you had that land last turn

[2019-02-21 02:29:29 UTC] pythoner6: At this point, you wouldn't have had more cards, because you've used all the treasures, right?
[2019-02-21 02:29:39 UTC] pythoner6: still having the cards earlier would have been better
[2019-02-21 02:29:50 UTC] canadianbac0nz: We knew about the the erasure so we absolutely shoulda saved the 2/2 and slammed the whirler
[2019-02-21 02:29:52 UTC] darkwolf1186: But he would have had a different amount of pressure 2 turns earlier
[2019-02-21 02:29:56 UTC] darkwolf1186: which is what you need in this matchup
[2019-02-21 02:30:07 UTC] thorandtwin: Finger's Crossed!

[2019-02-21 02:31:46 UTC] xxtippoxx: FYI opp cant win off teferi alone
[2019-02-21 02:31:50 UTC] kusabe: Does he have another win con other than teferi?
[2019-02-21 02:32:04 UTC] esdraelon: why is blue fun? all hes done the entire game is stop the game from happening yet
[2019-02-21 02:32:06 UTC] marlowe19: That’s very true, i get it. My (facetious) point was that the spike plan wouldn’t have worked right away anyway
[2019-02-21 02:32:16 UTC] gaimear: Game one boys and girls
[2019-02-21 02:32:18 UTC] darkwolf1186: Or you could keep drawing lava coil
[2019-02-21 02:32:27 UTC] pythoner6: @XxTippoxX you can, it just takes forever (you have teferi tuck himself while your opponent decks themself)
[2019-02-21 02:32:30 UTC] venfayth: who's winning the mill plan

[2019-02-21 02:33:14 UTC] bludysky: How do we win?
[2019-02-21 02:33:38 UTC] aperprose: You cant really mill his teferi though can you?
[2019-02-21 02:33:41 UTC] venfayth: i don't even think he can remove all your land
[2019-02-21 02:33:53 UTC] madscience532: they don't have enough cards left to exile your lands
[2019-02-21 02:33:57 UTC] phantomofares: I don't think you have enough mana to hellkite the tef to death
[2019-02-21 02:33:58 UTC] erdedyy: The exile animation is a bit dramatic I feel;
[2019-02-21 02:34:00 UTC] xxtippoxx: @pythoner6 he's lower in cards in deck
[2019-02-21 02:34:14 UTC] wildcard250: he took all our black mana
[2019-02-21 02:34:20 UTC] cartecher: i gotta say, such a deck would bore the shit out of me
[2019-02-21 02:34:34 UTC] wildcard250: he cna grab chromium now

[2019-02-21 02:36:05 UTC] canadianbac0nz: I think opponent forgot they have chromium in exile with a silver counter on it, that would have ended this a whole lot faster than these 1/1 LUL
[2019-02-21 02:36:14 UTC] aaron2a: @Day9tv can he have double emblem?
