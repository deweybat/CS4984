[2019-02-26 21:56:31 UTC] madscience532: @poaq imho , if you aren't super awesome at linear alegbra, that is always my suggestion. Estimation tends to be a lot of the intersection of linear algebra and stats. If you can do that, the language is sort of secondary. I'm not a major math nerd though. I did do a lot of modeling, estimation, detection, etc. in EE
[2019-02-26 21:56:33 UTC] sylvr: maybe too many reclamation tricks

[2019-02-26 21:58:34 UTC] chained_dog: That ooze sound though
[2019-02-26 21:58:37 UTC] ekhawkman: I share in the desire for the spicy sauces, but dislike the flavor of jalapeños.
[2019-02-26 21:58:50 UTC] poaq: @MadScience532 Yeah, my main struggle is I'm also trying to a better grasp on Python for functional stuff. So it's like trying to cram in linear algebra at 2am after working 14 hours
[2019-02-26 21:58:54 UTC] sylvos1470: I wonder how they did the foley work for that sound... gross.

[2019-02-26 21:59:29 UTC] artimaeus332: Naya Angels might be the way to go in these colors. Aurelia + the new mythic angel seems pretty good

[2019-02-26 22:03:41 UTC] zorbed_: @Day9tv Jeff Hoogland played a Temur Tempo deck a few days ago that seemed fun. It was kinda like Izzet Drakes but it had Deepwater Champion and Krasis instead of Crackling Drakes

[2019-02-26 22:22:06 UTC] ekhawkman: Banefire doesn't get countered, that's for sure.

[2019-02-26 22:22:20 UTC] venfayth: electrodominance is more of a combo piece than banefire, banefire is a finisher

[2019-02-26 22:22:35 UTC] zorbed_: @Day9tv maybe it just feels like it because you're facing a counterspell heavy deck?

[2019-02-26 22:22:38 UTC] phantomofares: I feel like Electrodominance might be best combined with smaller cards, not trying to get stuff like pelakka into the game

[2019-02-26 22:30:07 UTC] nuggettou: london mulligan: always draw 7 cards, then put x back at the bottom of deck where x is times you mulliganeds
[2019-02-26 22:30:08 UTC] hoofyrogers: if you mulligan again you still draw 7 but then discard down to 5
[2019-02-26 22:30:08 UTC] gilyu: Ennsentially, you always draw 7, but then put X card at the bottom for X times you mulligan
[2019-02-26 22:30:20 UTC] marlowe19: @jpcguy89 huh, interesting
[2019-02-26 22:30:20 UTC] lobstershrub: draw 7, mulligan, draw 7 put 1 on the bottom, mulligan, draw 7 put 2 on the bottowm, etc
[2019-02-26 22:30:21 UTC] m3tts: @day9tv You now always draw 7 Cards an then put "n" Cards on the Bottom where "n" is the Number of times you mulligand
[2019-02-26 22:30:32 UTC] cruxdelta: @Day9tv Isn't it kind of weird that Ravager Wyrm doesnt have trample?
[2019-02-26 22:30:32 UTC] otto_e_roddick: fiiiiive
[2019-02-26 22:30:48 UTC] streamchef: The london mulligan is reminiscent of the mulligan rule from "The Spoils". It strongly favours combo decks.
[2019-02-26 22:30:51 UTC] marlowe19: @jpcguy89 thanks!
[2019-02-26 22:30:51 UTC] whimax07: I wish the Wurm had trample.
[2019-02-26 22:30:58 UTC] streamchef: I think the mulligan is removed if you do a london mulligan
[2019-02-26 22:31:00 UTC] ascorgames: It just seems more user friendly
[2019-02-26 22:31:01 UTC] brohdr: and if you're me, you mulligan down to 2 and scry a non-land card to the bottom in the HOPE of getting a land on the first draw.
[2019-02-26 22:31:05 UTC] ekhawkman: He does have that risk factor.
[2019-02-26 22:31:14 UTC] jpcguy89: Yeah its definitely draw 7 cards each time
[2019-02-26 22:31:19 UTC] usaz: technically it's if you mulligan to less than 7, not at all, it's relevent in formats where you have a free mulligan
[2019-02-26 22:31:19 UTC] streamchef: I ment to say that the scry effect is removed in the london mulligan
[2019-02-26 22:31:23 UTC] dashbullettrain: I'm not sure I like the new rule. Instinctively it feels like it gives the player who mulligans more info on their deck vs someone who doesn't. Maybe I'm wrong, I would need to really sit down and math it out
[2019-02-26 22:31:24 UTC] hoofyrogers: im going to the magicfest in london. my first time going to an event on this scale. well excited
[2019-02-26 22:31:24 UTC] usaz: like edh
[2019-02-26 22:31:30 UTC] madscience532: I feel like its kind of weird to see it tested at the highest level of play. On the one had, we will definitely know if it's broken, but on the other it might be a goofy tournament.
[2019-02-26 22:31:33 UTC] n00odle: ello chat!
[2019-02-26 22:31:35 UTC] mrchapwhit: original rule was you wer only allowed to mulligan if you had either no lands or only lands
[2019-02-26 22:31:58 UTC] gilyu: It's already been tested internally, so now they are trying it out at a Modern tournement where they fear it might work the least well
[2019-02-26 22:32:06 UTC] gilyu: It's a big stress test
[2019-02-26 22:32:22 UTC] mrchapwhit: going to be very favorable to combo decks

[2019-02-26 22:33:25 UTC] nuggettou: I agree with what Jeff Hoogland said. This new rule will help consistency in all decks and if a card or deck is too broken with it then those cards maybe shouldnt be in the format
[2019-02-26 22:33:27 UTC] sephentos93: but why is it called london Mulligan
[2019-02-26 22:33:29 UTC] jackinev: im guessing you dont get to scry anymore at the end of the mulligan then?
[2019-02-26 22:33:36 UTC] rikjer: So. Why is it called a mulligan?
[2019-02-26 22:33:49 UTC] excalibur_z: @sephentos93 because they're literally debuting it in the london tournament LUL no other reason
[2019-02-26 22:33:54 UTC] madscience532: @sephentos93 They are testing it at mythic championship london
[2019-02-26 22:33:57 UTC] ascorgames: @sephentos93 Because else it'd be a chicago mulligan
[2019-02-26 22:33:57 UTC] ekhawkman: Even bettterrr
[2019-02-26 22:34:02 UTC] dashbullettrain: I see it as, say you mulligan to 5, so you put two cards to the bottom, that would be like getting a scry 2 that has to go to the bottom. So now you know two cards that are at the bottom while picking the best opening hand from what you drew. Maybe its fine, but my gut doesn't like it
[2019-02-26 22:34:04 UTC] vwemm: because you mull over your cards and decide if you want them again @rikjer ;)
[2019-02-26 22:34:10 UTC] dashbullettrain: I will have to see it in action to make an informed decision
[2019-02-26 22:34:13 UTC] vwemm: (this is likely not the true answer)
[2019-02-26 22:34:13 UTC] dkline9206: @rikjer mulligan is a fancy word for do over
[2019-02-26 22:34:17 UTC] gilyu: @Jackinev London Mulligan has no scry
[2019-02-26 22:34:33 UTC] jackinev: aight makes sense

[2019-02-26 22:35:23 UTC] cadamari: @DashBulletTrain It's better than scry 2 because those top 2 cards could be in your hand. It's the best 5 of seven cards.

[2019-02-26 22:36:25 UTC] karkesis: there was a card game called Force of Will that was almost identical to MTG mechanically but it had your land separate from your deck and it was my favorite thing, I loved that game moon2PH
[2019-02-26 22:36:25 UTC] gilyu: Scry X also has the issue where possibilities with it are exponential, Scry 1 has 2 results, Scry 2 has... 3 results? And it keeps getting bigger and bigger

[2019-02-26 22:47:48 UTC] patrickjrm: @Flintheart you get more free decks every day, but probably avoid anything with a buy-in until youre familiar with the cards
[2019-02-26 22:47:49 UTC] zorbed_: @Flintheart grinding gold to open packs. I love draft but it doesn't give you wildcards which you need to build constructed decks
[2019-02-26 22:47:51 UTC] dkline9206: @Day9tv @chat it has been lovely but i have procrastinated on getting ready for work for FAR TOO LONG. I will see you all on a later date

[2019-02-26 22:49:54 UTC] nuggettou: @Day9tv I think this deck would be much stronger in bo3, being able to sideboard in more removal games 2 and 3 would really help
[2019-02-26 22:50:17 UTC] flintheart: Thanks @vwemm @PatrickJRM @zorbed_ . Good decks seem quite expensive, but I guess the grind is necessary. Having fun with the free merman deck so far, but want to eventually play more controlly.
[2019-02-26 22:50:33 UTC] vwemm: @Flintheart the merman one is probably the most solid starter deck
[2019-02-26 22:50:53 UTC] ondaryn: o snap the memes
[2019-02-26 22:50:58 UTC] vwemm: @Flintheart I like drafts + sealed to build the deck. sure you get less wildcards in theory, but you get to play more games + earn some cards :)
[2019-02-26 22:51:01 UTC] atrulyneutralparticle: @Flintheart You get there eventually, im currently running a grixis midrange deck in diamond without spending any money, just grinding the daily quests out
[2019-02-26 22:51:05 UTC] patrickjrm: @Flintheart you can google guides to slowly upgrade the beginner decks as you gain more cards, and i think the merfolk one is considered the best of the bunch as is as well as with some upgrades
[2019-02-26 22:51:07 UTC] vwemm: @Flintheart also, as you get better it starts becoming more cost effective.

[2019-02-26 22:52:53 UTC] nuggettou: Collision//colossus seems good here as well, more flyer removal and some extra push

[2019-02-26 23:22:51 UTC] patrickjrm: everyones focusing on the trigger of "when an opponent casts an instant or sorcery" and ignoring that the result does nothing

[2019-02-26 23:44:05 UTC] fun_on_a_bun010: shadow of the colossus is totally linear
[2019-02-26 23:44:05 UTC] ang8811: BOTW is so amazing too although not a metroidvania obviously lol
[2019-02-26 23:44:15 UTC] ang8811: BOTW had the perfect amount of structure but with freedom to explore IMO
[2019-02-26 23:44:18 UTC] ang8811: just open world enough
[2019-02-26 23:44:26 UTC] subssanssoda: shadow of the colossus, aka run 10 minutes in this direction with nothing going on LUL

[2019-02-26 23:45:25 UTC] loleona: Subnautica?

[2019-02-26 23:45:50 UTC] scipio323: See, the weakest part of Twilight Princess to me was the over-reliance on dungeons
[2019-02-26 23:45:51 UTC] ang8811: by mid game you have so many weapons the durability doesn't even matter really
[2019-02-26 23:45:52 UTC] plaague: how do you make exploration challenging without seeming linear about it?
[2019-02-26 23:46:00 UTC] ang8811: its just early game its annoying
[2019-02-26 23:46:01 UTC] meltorefas: i also love the animated series they made based on SotN and Castlevania III
[2019-02-26 23:46:19 UTC] scipio323: it felt like you would spend 10 minutes in the overworld and then you were in the next dungeon.
[2019-02-26 23:46:27 UTC] zmclightning: the castlevania animated series was a wonderful show
[2019-02-26 23:46:30 UTC] subssanssoda: @ang8811 what if there's a rare/unique weapon you just like using, regardless of how good it is?

[2019-02-26 23:46:42 UTC] bigfriendlyviking: Would you classify Subnautica under that category?
[2019-02-26 23:46:46 UTC] sandcastle92: @Mateuuuuusz I found that the getting lost in exploring dungeons was replaced by exploring the world of BOTW for me, and getting into some of the shrines were puzzles in themselves

[2019-02-26 23:47:16 UTC] ang8811: @SubsSansSoda I didn't really notice anything that amazing I guess? There weren't very many unique weapons it was mostly just higher damage 1 hand sword, or higher damage axe, or whatever + elements
[2019-02-26 23:47:17 UTC] twofishtwo: is subnautica procesdurally generated?
[2019-02-26 23:47:17 UTC] marlowe19: How goes it @erdedyy
[2019-02-26 23:47:25 UTC] kelta7: Valdis Story was a bit more combat oriented, but a cool game too
[2019-02-26 23:47:25 UTC] ang8811: So i don't think it felt that bad when they broke
[2019-02-26 23:47:37 UTC] erdedyy: had a job interview today which I thought went well, other than that not a thang
[2019-02-26 23:47:41 UTC] ang8811: Like if there were some really unique playstyle weapons I would have cared more
[2019-02-26 23:47:47 UTC] mateuuuuusz: Just felt too far away from Zelda for me. I keep trying to revisit it to see if the feeling chanfes
[2019-02-26 23:47:48 UTC] ang8811: but mostly I just went and punched things in the face til they died

[2019-02-26 23:50:11 UTC] cuda09: @Day9tv I was wondering if you would ever consider playing Xcom2 on stream on a day off. I noticed you played Xcom 1 on stream a while back and I really think you would enjoy the new one and it would be a great watch imo. Plus with the turn based play you can watch chat very easily.
[2019-02-26 23:50:22 UTC] sagerin0: @ang8811 wow, i have not thought about thta ever, but now that youve said that, i agree
[2019-02-26 23:50:25 UTC] sandcastle92: @ang8811 i want that so badly
[2019-02-26 23:50:25 UTC] venfayth: i have a ton of respect for the art in both hollow knight and ori and the blind forest, but i just don't like playing those games because of the art style

[2019-02-26 23:50:38 UTC] kelta7: It's so easy to be positive about Hollow Knight because the devs are awesome too, they do so much cool stuff, give you some free DLC, remember the help of their first backers, etc.
[2019-02-26 23:50:59 UTC] sagerin0: @Dhrenzen odyssey was great but i liked sunshine better

[2019-02-26 23:51:41 UTC] dhrenzen: I mean they spent their time making Odyssey instead. Nintendo can only develop so many things at once
[2019-02-26 23:51:42 UTC] ang8811: @Day9tv Two different people I knew gave up on it because they were completely lost and had no idea what to do
[2019-02-26 23:51:49 UTC] marlowe19: @sandcastle92 agreed, and I’d add “the room”
[2019-02-26 23:51:55 UTC] patriarchreliance: that's the best thing about it though
[2019-02-26 23:51:56 UTC] dhrenzen: and Odyssey was a smash hit so they'll likely continue to focus on it

[2019-02-26 23:52:21 UTC] kelta7: I recommended Hollow Knight to a friend of mine who loved Ori and she couldn't finish it because of the combat, it can be quite tricky some time I guess if you're not game savvy
