[2019-02-20 00:36:08 UTC] jpcguy89: Then why would winning bring me down?

[2019-02-20 00:36:39 UTC] anotherpylon: percentage of players in mythic?
[2019-02-20 00:36:42 UTC] marb04: @jpcguy89 congrats
[2019-02-20 00:36:44 UTC] lysozyme: but, you can still go down after winning a game - because other people might climb higher than you whilst you're playing that game
[2019-02-20 00:36:45 UTC] rrwoods: % means higher is better (you are better than that many players) -- # means lower is better (you are the nth best)

[2019-02-20 00:37:04 UTC] vyous: better than 89% of players maybe? as opposed to "the top x%"
[2019-02-20 00:37:15 UTC] onebaldfreak: It's how far you have to go until you're in the top 100

[2019-02-20 00:42:27 UTC] izaacly: Do you remember the card Tramatize @Day9tv ? Mill was incredibly fun with that
[2019-02-20 00:42:27 UTC] lionhardt544: For anyone in chat wondering, Patient Rebuilding says " At the beginning of your upkeep, target opponent puts the top three cards of their library into their graveyard, then you draw a card for each land card put into that graveyard this way."
[2019-02-20 00:42:30 UTC] frazzlewaz: read "The saga of Recluse" by L.E. Moddesitt

[2019-02-20 00:42:36 UTC] vyous: Yeah, I've tried patient, and while it's sweet, it's also just really slow.

[2019-02-20 00:42:42 UTC] lionhardt544: If you want to put in more defense, might as well run Wall of Lost Thoughts right?

[2019-02-20 01:02:28 UTC] lionhardt544: @Excalibur_Z It's weak in limited, but here it's good because of the recursion. Mill casts a lot of instant speed draw to trigger Psychic Corrosion and doesn't care when it casts it, so we get Dovin's back. It also helps us live longer and triggers Psychic Corrosion even more.

[2019-02-20 01:32:46 UTC] darykohi: Usually you don't run more than 60 cards because you want your deck to be focused in what it does and consistent. (since the card type cap is 4)

[2019-02-20 12:29:34 UTC] cmdrmn: that image must be like a bunch of high analog zoom images stitched together right

[2019-02-20 13:08:41 UTC] cmdrmn: i just thought of a genius idea. you know those little solar powered light post things that people put along sidewalks to light the way? you just replace those with giant industrial fans and when it snows it just puts the snow to the side
[2019-02-20 13:08:44 UTC] orbdf: we get many more than 4 this morning and I am werk from home

[2019-02-20 13:16:11 UTC] cmdrmn: you just gotta plan better
[2019-02-20 13:20:48 UTC] cmdrmn: especially when the consensus around here seems to be "doesn't make sense to plow till the snow stops"
[2019-02-20 13:29:59 UTC] orbdf: yeah very true

[2019-02-20 15:43:19 UTC] pumpnineteen: why, when ppl are naming a colour after a thing, do they make sure the colour looks nothing like the thing they are naming it after?
[2019-02-20 15:43:40 UTC] brassraven: colour blindness
[2019-02-20 15:44:18 UTC] brassraven: Or tetrachrmacy
[2019-02-20 15:45:39 UTC] pumpnineteen: neither are valid answer, unless we accept that the tiny fraction of people who have abnormal colour vision name 99% of colours
[2019-02-20 15:46:17 UTC] pumpnineteen: I do have a partial answer
[2019-02-20 15:48:54 UTC] pumpnineteen: which is in most cases the thing they are naming after vary wildly in colour AND most colours on things are not uniform, flat colours
[2019-02-20 15:49:47 UTC] pumpnineteen: but even so, ppl manage to name colours in such a way that the named colour doesn't appear anywhere on the thing
[2019-02-20 15:53:41 UTC] brassraven: maybe they came up with a good name and when they submitted it they got a letter back saying "that name is already taken, choose another one"

[2019-02-20 22:02:07 UTC] albyhouse: Hey @Day9tv, I have an interesting problem at work. Software development, and recently through some nepitism a student got hired who is way smarter than my whole team and writes code way above our usual level. I'm not sure how to handle it and it's hard to get smarter, ya know
[2019-02-20 22:02:27 UTC] subssanssoda: i just learned that wherever something about the netherlands is posted, a message saying [GEKOLONISEERD] (meaning colonized) is not far away

[2019-02-20 22:03:04 UTC] dallassooner87: @albyhouse it sounds like he didn't get the job through nepotism if he is smart and writing code at a higher level than the team is used to. FWIW.

[2019-02-20 22:03:28 UTC] albyhouse: Hard to debug his code since I don't know how it works, if/when he leaves we are stuck with code above our pay grade. Hard to program on apps with him if his code isn't in line with us

[2019-02-20 22:04:20 UTC] dhrenzen: @albyhouse do code reviews where documentation/readability is a benchmark that you can measure. quick code that nobody else can read is worthless

[2019-02-20 22:07:09 UTC] albyhouse: @Supremacy037 I agree with that, but its hard to explain to someone to write simpler code who think they are writing complicated code and is very necessary. At some point I can just pull rank, but I think this is a good learning experience for him (and me)

[2019-02-20 22:23:07 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: @WittyAdrian they've advanced, the cows now collect cards and all hate blue decks dayUhoh
[2019-02-20 22:23:08 UTC] subssanssoda: like streamlining gone too far, and making it too simplified?
[2019-02-20 22:23:19 UTC] wittyadrian: @DottoreLunchmeat hahaha nice, I love it
[2019-02-20 22:23:32 UTC] n00odle: AH I C
[2019-02-20 22:23:40 UTC] erdedyy: I feel like a lot of the adjustments you're talking about made sc2 feel so different than brood war, unlimited control group sizes, workers are smarter and stronger, easier unit pathing
[2019-02-20 22:24:03 UTC] grumpykitten16: you can argue that the medal system is worse but I like the lack of a scoreboard in Overwatch
[2019-02-20 22:24:05 UTC] dallassooner87: I thought the shared level was a wonderful idea. They wanted to make the game a brawler and not a traditional moba. The shared levels lets you fight more than a long laming phase.
[2019-02-20 22:24:06 UTC] n00odle: @Cheeseyx define unhealty
[2019-02-20 22:24:10 UTC] mmangg: I want more stat tracking in Arena and Hearthstone
[2019-02-20 22:24:15 UTC] bludysky: Are we talking about the dumbing down of games?
[2019-02-20 22:24:57 UTC] sylvos1470: @day9tv I’ve found games have been making it harder to find newer games that hurt, the fair but brutal nature such as soulsbourne games or cuphead are rarer, do you think that’s an intentional direction of the gaming industry?
[2019-02-20 22:25:19 UTC] dallassooner87: we die
[2019-02-20 22:25:21 UTC] dallassooner87: thats why
[2019-02-20 22:25:21 UTC] n00odle: I think we are talking about the games today kinda "cares" about the feelings of the players instead of the performance
[2019-02-20 22:25:23 UTC] lysozyme: because he has lethal now
[2019-02-20 22:25:27 UTC] cruendithas: They want lethal with drakes
[2019-02-20 22:25:29 UTC] mmangg: Digging to win the game?
[2019-02-20 22:25:32 UTC] ascorgames: @sylvos1470 I think it's the general steer away from the really old games that were ALL hard as hell or downright unfair.
[2019-02-20 22:25:32 UTC] nuggettou: chart a course pre combat to make drakes bigger
[2019-02-20 22:25:33 UTC] n00odle: apex?
[2019-02-20 22:25:38 UTC] n00odle: tf2?
[2019-02-20 22:25:40 UTC] ascorgames: @sylvos1470 Maybe it'll balance out in a couple of years.

[2019-02-20 22:25:45 UTC] n00odle: fortnite?
[2019-02-20 22:25:46 UTC] tanath_raal: @Day9tv What type of deck has been the most fun to play so far? Also, which type of deck do you believe has the highest power level? Gotta say golgari superfriends look sick :D
[2019-02-20 22:25:52 UTC] gunny: I miss MAG. I enjoyed that FPS
[2019-02-20 22:25:52 UTC] ekhawkman: Speaking of games that beat you up, darkest dungeon 2 coming out.
[2019-02-20 22:25:54 UTC] cheeseyx: @n00odle Generally, people get really mad and sometimes end up pushing through game after game when tilted where they ought to take a break or something
[2019-02-20 22:26:03 UTC] nuggettou: I think you still need the elves
[2019-02-20 22:26:09 UTC] sylvos1470: @ascorgames good point asc
[2019-02-20 22:26:17 UTC] subssanssoda: most old games were hard, because if they weren't, they would be over in like 2 hours
[2019-02-20 22:26:18 UTC] unicornjam: tbh the gaming community has a history of toxicity and i think it's important to combat that in some ways
[2019-02-20 22:26:19 UTC] superkamigurur: I havent played an FPS since MAG lol
[2019-02-20 22:26:23 UTC] subssanssoda: it was limitation of the days
[2019-02-20 22:26:38 UTC] cheeseyx: So overwatch makes it hard to rage at teammates for poor performance by not making it clear how they're performing, for instance.
[2019-02-20 22:26:53 UTC] frazzlewaz: @day9tv is this a hooooooooogland list?
[2019-02-20 22:26:58 UTC] panzeze: I'm currently so excited for friday's mostly walking, I've played through all that game and it's been really amazing
[2019-02-20 22:27:09 UTC] sylvos1470: Sean what’s your “I’m daySick ” feel better food
[2019-02-20 22:27:13 UTC] cheeseyx: Which is an attempt to reduce raging, but the core reason for raging isn't because you can see that your teammates are door poorly
[2019-02-20 22:27:23 UTC] dallassooner87: @frazzlewaz he doesnt run frilled mystics or didnt yesterday. Unless he put them in for the tournament today
[2019-02-20 22:27:23 UTC] n00odle: @Cheeseyx oh I see, well in that case yes
[2019-02-20 22:27:30 UTC] johnny_devo: the way you're dropping lands you'd think you're a RG deck
[2019-02-20 22:27:40 UTC] cruendithas: And again LUL
[2019-02-20 22:27:41 UTC] mmangg: One of the reasons I dislike a lot of multiplayer games is because I feel like the games are designed to play me more than designed for me to play them.
[2019-02-20 22:27:48 UTC] grumpykitten16: @cheeseyx it stops a particular person being targeted though
[2019-02-20 22:27:54 UTC] unicornjam: @Cheeseyx what do you think about the commend/reputation thing they implemented?
[2019-02-20 22:28:02 UTC] sheepsaymeh: I feel like all the battle royale games show this phenomenon, there's really no feel of progression when there's no ranking system
[2019-02-20 22:28:02 UTC] n00odle: Im ok with multiplayer based games
[2019-02-20 22:28:03 UTC] clydesdalle: Im upset they couldve done more clacking with the Growth Chamber Guardian. Missed out on a clacky opportunity.
[2019-02-20 22:28:34 UTC] cheeseyx: @grumpykitten16 Usually yes, although sometimes people just assume someone's not contributing due to being a sniper or something
[2019-02-20 22:28:48 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: @Cheeseyx Sniping's a good job, mate dayHmm
[2019-02-20 22:28:50 UTC] mmangg: I feel like Sean saying bing bong is somehow offensive, but ovviously not
[2019-02-20 22:28:57 UTC] grumpykitten16: that is true
[2019-02-20 22:29:04 UTC] sylvos1470: I think it’s amazing that even games that don’t have direct chat can still find ways to flame people, for example spamming “nice save” in rocket league or the always toxic “sorry” button in hs
[2019-02-20 22:29:04 UTC] cheeseyx: @unicornjam I haven't played overwatch too much since it was implemented so I don't know what sort of effect it's actually had
[2019-02-20 22:29:12 UTC] n00odle: fortnite and the like doesnt have a ranked system because I think adding that feature into the game could cause a clash between competitive and non competitive people
[2019-02-20 22:29:13 UTC] subssanssoda: the problem is also that as soon as you attach ANYTHING as a reward for a competitive game/mode, things turn toxic so fast and so hard
[2019-02-20 22:29:17 UTC] johnny_devo: well you WERE asking about blue sources earlier
[2019-02-20 22:29:37 UTC] nuggettou: feeels prett
[2019-02-20 22:29:42 UTC] unicornjam: I would say the new reputation system in OW has helped
[2019-02-20 22:29:45 UTC] n00odle: toxicity is eher frustration. or hiper competitiviness
[2019-02-20 22:29:46 UTC] subssanssoda: i dont wanna play a game so i can hear 20 people say they fucked my mother and i should play tetris
[2019-02-20 22:29:57 UTC] tsully87: My biggest gripe with a lot of modern games they ship with a lack of dedicated server or level editor. It's nice to see what the community can make of a game.
[2019-02-20 22:30:09 UTC] n00odle: for example OW is a really easy game with easy mechanics individually
[2019-02-20 22:30:09 UTC] unicornjam: @SubsSansSoda that's the whole point of gaming duh
[2019-02-20 22:30:20 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: you weren
[2019-02-20 22:30:36 UTC] n00odle: But working together with other 5 people that's complicated
[2019-02-20 22:30:37 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: t good at call of duty in the days of youre if you didnt get rude comments in voice chat dayTroll
[2019-02-20 22:30:41 UTC] cruendithas: Same person?
[2019-02-20 22:30:45 UTC] sylvos1470: What’s your biggest takeaway from the games on stream in ny? Learn anything concrete from the pros?
[2019-02-20 22:30:53 UTC] cruendithas: Nahh, different
[2019-02-20 22:31:24 UTC] frazzlewaz: perseus is a good player. i believe our record is 1 and 1
[2019-02-20 22:31:32 UTC] ascorgames: @Day9tv Does that tie into the "people evalute emotional peaks more highly"?
[2019-02-20 22:31:50 UTC] subssanssoda: BUUUUUUT
[2019-02-20 22:31:54 UTC] sylvos1470: Like nexus of fate?
[2019-02-20 22:31:57 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: success and victory is worthless if there's nothing to overcome
[2019-02-20 22:32:10 UTC] n00odle: exaclty !, that's why so many people are scared of the ladder in sc2 or sc
[2019-02-20 22:32:20 UTC] unicornjam: sometimes i feel like day9 streams are also interesting lectures in class or something
[2019-02-20 22:32:46 UTC] vwemm: just watched the pixar short D:
[2019-02-20 22:32:51 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: Fiiighttt SMOrc
[2019-02-20 22:32:52 UTC] cheeseyx: I think there's also variation in what tolerance for pain vs reward different people have. Some people really love to push through punishment in the way of Soulsborne games or really technical multiplayer games.
[2019-02-20 22:33:26 UTC] subssanssoda: i also feel like a lot of games dont teach/show you what you're doing wrong. if i get stomped in 3 minutes in a SC game, what am i supposed to learn from that?
[2019-02-20 22:33:44 UTC] cheeseyx: Draw 1 into jadelight, easy
[2019-02-20 22:33:53 UTC] n00odle: @Cheeseyx agreed soulsborne games are hard if you're careless

[2019-02-20 22:34:42 UTC] excalibur_z: how come the opponent couldn't block with their remaining 1/1?
[2019-02-20 22:34:44 UTC] sylvos1470: Do you split the difficulty to reward of games like dark souls and say, Celeste? @day9tv
[2019-02-20 22:34:47 UTC] n00odle: imagine the feeling I felt loosing 2k of blood echoes at lvl 1
[2019-02-20 22:34:49 UTC] gollysnoster: Sean my football team won the game \o/

[2019-02-20 22:35:00 UTC] dallassooner87: I beat hollow kinght last night. The hidden last boss is much difficult
[2019-02-20 22:35:02 UTC] gunny: Congrats @gollysnoster
[2019-02-20 22:35:11 UTC] cheeseyx: I wonder if some of the attempts to 'smooth out' games that have elements that are difficult/hostile but also meaningful... How much of that is meant to make the game palatable to a wider range of people
[2019-02-20 22:35:26 UTC] dhrenzen: @Excalibur_Z the damage buff was applied in the 'damage' phase which happens after the 'declare blockers' phase, so they skipped blocking in that earlier phase
[2019-02-20 22:35:34 UTC] ekhawkman: Hollow Knight is so gorgeous and so cool, but man I'm bad at those skills.

[2019-02-20 22:37:21 UTC] zifnab84: @EKHawkman tbh so I thought as well, but I bashed my head on it enough to get at least proficient
[2019-02-20 22:37:23 UTC] subssanssoda: that's because our brain is bad at numbers

[2019-02-20 22:40:37 UTC] brettyw63: is it possible to gift subs

[2019-02-20 22:49:27 UTC] subssanssoda: and there were some interesting points someone made in a commentary, like the AI having 700 APM, and having absolute perfect micro, which lets.. it? do insane stalker micro

[2019-02-20 22:55:57 UTC] subssanssoda: but how for example is mouse movement etc incorporated in that? because if you want to move 20 stalkers, individually, blinking them seperately, no way a human would be able to do that

[2019-02-20 23:16:39 UTC] sixpointfive: We were 2 of the 6?

[2019-02-20 23:18:26 UTC] thegrumbler: I did that in Halo with my brothers some, return to camping spots that had become used so much that they had become dangerous to use. I would return to those spots even though they were "bad" spots, and sometimes it worked really well.
[2019-02-20 23:18:31 UTC] horsebag: Lookit him leaning on that tree
[2019-02-20 23:18:32 UTC] typhoidrat: @day9tv if you want a new deck idea, you should play a combo deck based on "Sanguine Sacrament" , March of the multitudes, and Azor's Gateway. Make like 200 tokens with Primal Amulet too.

[2019-02-20 23:19:10 UTC] ang8811: tbh krasis doesn't need trample it would still be super stronk without it

[2019-02-20 23:21:05 UTC] sixpointfive: With the new space marines coming out too

[2019-02-20 23:22:00 UTC] thegrumbler: LUL pet cow
[2019-02-20 23:22:03 UTC] highercalibur: Only downside to the Beta Bolter rules is that they need to be clarified so that Terminators and Bikers in Veteran squads can make use of them. They lose the keywords that would let them move and fire double.
[2019-02-20 23:22:06 UTC] sagerin0: ORKS IZ BEZT SMOrc

[2019-02-20 23:23:17 UTC] highercalibur: @SixPointFive There are so many random little rules that wind up affecting them later on. I'm sure they'll include it in the FAQ in a few months so I'm not worried.

[2019-02-20 23:24:33 UTC] beermanman: Games are nice for training AI because of the well-defined heuristics.
[2019-02-20 23:24:46 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: like the MC from that VN about esports? 🤔
[2019-02-20 23:24:49 UTC] sixpointfive: I'm setting up a janky list for the Dicehamemr GT coming up

[2019-02-20 23:25:06 UTC] the_lotion: Seems like the DOTA openai has more of the, “well that’s weird.” Moments than the sc2 one with its more structured approach.
[2019-02-20 23:25:15 UTC] highercalibur: You play Chaos @SixPointFive ?
[2019-02-20 23:25:29 UTC] sixpointfive: I play a monster mash ya. @HigherCalibur

[2019-02-20 23:25:50 UTC] banksy_collective: So if you are practicing against known steady gameplans, how are they anticipating the meta, so to speak?
[2019-02-20 23:25:53 UTC] highercalibur: @SixPointFive What are your thoughts on Cypher allowing for Chaos to run the Assassin toolbox?
[2019-02-20 23:25:57 UTC] aarimous: @Day9tv I think teaching it to play SC2 was a learning experiment just like you doing to Cow vs Farmer was to teach you about AI's. SC2 was just a nice semi-complex sandbox.
[2019-02-20 23:26:03 UTC] subssanssoda: yeah that's nice and all, but can it solve a sudoku?

[2019-02-20 23:27:11 UTC] subssanssoda: @beermanman that's nice and all, but can it shoot hoops 100% of the time?
[2019-02-20 23:27:11 UTC] stillvirginxp: @SixPointFive i would so love to play a high count helbrute death guard list, but they are just so squishy w/o demonic ++save or disguistingly resilient :/

[2019-02-20 23:29:02 UTC] subssanssoda: when will there be an AI that's as versatile as a human brain? like, how good would the SC AI do in another RTS game, or an entirely different game altogether, if that makes sense?
[2019-02-20 23:29:09 UTC] drgsabin: I didn't know they even had anything other than bo1

[2019-02-20 23:29:13 UTC] ang8811: why play a card game for interesting counterplay between you and the opponent when you can play solitaire instead? ResidentSleeper
[2019-02-20 23:29:15 UTC] rangora: isnt it disrupting the gameplay as much in bo3?

[2019-02-20 23:29:34 UTC] adammarr: oh great. I get that you can tech around it in BO1, post sideboard, it's still infuriating to play against.
[2019-02-20 23:29:44 UTC] adammarr: BO3*
[2019-02-20 23:29:44 UTC] stillvirginxp: @HigherCalibur yeah, got the bloat drones in my army, but i just love the helbrute models. also think i would just prefer taking more plagueburst crawlers with double flamers than drones, but not sure yet don't have enough of them
[2019-02-20 23:29:48 UTC] ang8811: @SubsSansSoda I for one welcome our new robotic overlords
[2019-02-20 23:29:51 UTC] dredgeforlife: to get the "Traditional" play ooption you have to have the Toggle on the home page turned on
[2019-02-20 23:30:01 UTC] five99one: SubsSansSoda yeah, once AI becomes broadly intelligent (vs. specifically intelligent as it is now) it will probably quickly surpass us and become essentially a god
[2019-02-20 23:30:02 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: @rangora iirc bo3 is supposed to be a perfect mirror of paper magic, where you can show the infinite combo and concede, as well as sideboard in a counter
[2019-02-20 23:30:15 UTC] five99one: SubsSansSoda which means we'll either become immortal or extinct
[2019-02-20 23:30:24 UTC] subssanssoda: and that would be the singularity, right?
[2019-02-20 23:30:26 UTC] highercalibur: @StillVirginxP My only issue with the Crawlers is the low BS.

[2019-02-20 23:31:00 UTC] stillvirginxp: @HigherCalibur yeah, thats why i would double flamer them and push them infront as flamers autohit.
[2019-02-20 23:31:14 UTC] five99one: I don't actually understand why people complain about how boring Nexus is to play against. Can't you just concede if you've already lost?

[2019-02-20 23:32:19 UTC] the_bean: my fave openai tactic was the axe culling blade for damage which ceb used in game 4 of the final

[2019-02-20 23:32:31 UTC] five99one: Sounds like those people just don't like combo/control decks
[2019-02-20 23:32:31 UTC] highercalibur: @StillVirginxP Fair enough. They're still one of the better vehicles in the game. Faced off against 3 of them + 3 Bloat Drones + a unit of 3 Mephitic Haulers. Was tough getting points out of him lol

[2019-02-20 23:34:18 UTC] jovo: It helped a lot that openAI was built with a goal that, while open-ended in its strategy, still had some specific parameters: 1v1, mid, SF

[2019-02-20 23:39:27 UTC] the_bean: what is the not-awful application for this tech? why make it?
[2019-02-20 23:39:27 UTC] omahunek: Like I don't think we are at all capable of preparing for that kind of AI by just knowing that people like OpenAI made one. Society has to respond to it. That said it's definitely better than just releasing it with no warning.
[2019-02-20 23:39:45 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: the cynic in me feels a little like their announcement of how they made such a big bad thing thats too scary to show the world is them upselling themselves some more, but thats just me dayDerp
[2019-02-20 23:39:47 UTC] dallassooner87: @lysmith you are aware most warfare today is intelligence warfare right? an AI that can compellingly look human and super convincing is super dangerous in that world.
[2019-02-20 23:39:51 UTC] beermanman: Taking the Luddite path of preventing AI development is dangerous and rushing out a release early is also dangerous. It's a balance beam.
[2019-02-20 23:39:56 UTC] stillvirginxp: @HigherCalibur if you are taking plagueburst instead of drones, you are taking 18less points and you get 2W, 1T, +1S for flamers, you lose 1mov, melee weapon and flying but also get some more long range weapons. so i think it could be a good idea

[2019-02-20 23:40:38 UTC] lysmith: @dallassooner87 sure, information warfare is a thing, i get that, it isn't necessarily comparable to a physical device that unlocks anything

[2019-02-20 23:41:15 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Day9tv And I'm sure they could come up with fake comments that have a conversation with each other, that makes it seem like their fake news has a strong argument and is convincing other people.

[2019-02-20 23:41:35 UTC] erdedyy: Perhaps a gift in disguise? If you look at social media as the cigarettes of our generation, it might be nice for it to be completely and utterly useless instead of only slightly useless as it is now. People might move on.

[2019-02-20 23:42:12 UTC] the_bean: what is the practical intended use for this text generator? why was it made if it's so dangerous? I don't get it.
[2019-02-20 23:42:14 UTC] zeniph: I might add, if you were to also create an AI that could edit photos and create realistic fake photos, to go along with realistic fake text, you can fairly successfully fool populace, if not start to sway world order.

[2019-02-20 23:43:16 UTC] stillvirginxp: @HigherCalibur for pox to be useful you really have to take the whole package with buffs, and i really prefer playing more of a mech style less infantry.
[2019-02-20 23:43:22 UTC] walkwithoutrhythm: People are way more likely to engage with an idea if they see a conflict surrounding it, The text generator could create the illusion of conflict with trivial effort
[2019-02-20 23:43:24 UTC] omahunek: @Day9tv But they should release that information to the people who need the info to fix the vulnerability. In this case the people who need the information are all of society

[2019-02-20 23:44:25 UTC] omahunek: I think OpenAI made the right call, it just worries me because like... is the person who finally releases one of these dangerous AIs going to tell anyone? Will we have any warning? OpenAI could warn us if they did it, but if responsible people don't do it, it will be left to the irresponsible and untrustworthy.

The model itself only does unconditional generation, which means there's no way to control the generation itself. Furthermore, they are releasing the training code and they descirbed how they obtained t

[2019-02-20 23:51:03 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Day9tv Have you read Nick Bostrom's Super Intelligence? It's pretty convincing that we're basically boned wrt the field of Artificial Technology
[2019-02-20 23:51:23 UTC] gunny: What if their ai took over and is the one not letting itself be released
[2019-02-20 23:51:28 UTC] kcaz95: literally just more data :)
[2019-02-20 23:51:35 UTC] lysozyme: @Day9tv would you ever consider doing audiobook voice recordings
[2019-02-20 23:51:37 UTC] pridephulone: @Day9tv thanks for the entertaining content. Is this what it feels like to be rich? (flex sub badge)
[2019-02-20 23:51:46 UTC] subssanssoda: what if WE'RE the AI! :o
[2019-02-20 23:52:10 UTC] liverflap: cannot recommend and second Superintelligence enough! so good
[2019-02-20 23:52:29 UTC] ang8811: what if the real AI was the friends we made along the way?
[2019-02-20 23:52:29 UTC] liverflap: dayBroken daySick
[2019-02-20 23:52:41 UTC] tin_fox: I know this is me just being downer, but I've been working really hard at learning to draw and it bums me out pretty hard that we'll probably sooner or later just have AI that can do it better than I ever could in a fraction of the time. It makes my efforts feel sort of worthless
[2019-02-20 23:52:42 UTC] subssanssoda: @ang8811 LUL
[2019-02-20 23:52:52 UTC] pawcakes: Chugalug?
[2019-02-20 23:52:53 UTC] the_imperative: chug a lug
[2019-02-20 23:52:56 UTC] rilel: Chugga chugga!
[2019-02-20 23:53:02 UTC] subssanssoda: chugga chugga
[2019-02-20 23:53:10 UTC] giffythegif: seee nnn dddd hhhh eee ll pppp
[2019-02-20 23:53:11 UTC] jovo: Games offer a billion easily measured metrics for examine and analyze
[2019-02-20 23:53:11 UTC] subssanssoda: is it back to 9 minutes again?!
[2019-02-20 23:53:16 UTC] lysozyme: still chug
[2019-02-20 23:53:16 UTC] mr_valdyr: it got darker!
[2019-02-20 23:53:20 UTC] ang8811: we need a coors light stream where we all drink with the chugs
[2019-02-20 23:53:20 UTC] fledgyapplehands: Yo, my name's Chug the penguin
[2019-02-20 23:53:20 UTC] k9kroz: dayChug
[2019-02-20 23:53:23 UTC] manonano512: @Tin_Fox Don't worry. I'm in med school monkaS
[2019-02-20 23:53:24 UTC] dhrenzen: dayChug
[2019-02-20 23:53:29 UTC] jazz_xvii: Chug chug
[2019-02-20 23:53:35 UTC] bacotaco: what is a chug
[2019-02-20 23:53:39 UTC] subssanssoda: dayChug should become an emote
[2019-02-20 23:53:43 UTC] gunny: Have you checked your power settings on the streaming computer?
[2019-02-20 23:53:47 UTC] fledgyapplehands: wait, how does Day9 fix it now?
[2019-02-20 23:53:48 UTC] cheeseyx: I don't think the risk of a hyperintelligent general AI is that large, but there's a lot of ways even simpler AIs can be abused or lead to bad things on their own
[2019-02-20 23:53:50 UTC] liverflap: dayChug = comp with estus flask?
[2019-02-20 23:54:00 UTC] gunny: Specifically around reducing PCIe power usage
[2019-02-20 23:54:02 UTC] count_brennuvarg: Could it be the connection between your PCs that is causing the issues?
[2019-02-20 23:54:21 UTC] erdedyy: AI paintings recently have been extremely cool
[2019-02-20 23:54:21 UTC] dhrenzen: creativity is the only thing that AI will never beat humans at
[2019-02-20 23:54:36 UTC] questworthy: Isn't an AI painting just a more complicated version of taking a picture?
[2019-02-20 23:54:50 UTC] jovo: Assuming the cap card is the the thing failing, you could just go over network until you get a replacement
[2019-02-20 23:54:51 UTC] cheeseyx: Such as how content recommendation algorithms keep prioritizing things like convincing people of conspiracy theories because that gets more clicks
[2019-02-20 23:55:03 UTC] lysozyme: Why decline?
[2019-02-20 23:55:03 UTC] gunny: Deep fakes are scary
[2019-02-20 23:55:11 UTC] fledgyapplehands: @dhrenzen I mean... never is a strong word
[2019-02-20 23:55:12 UTC] erdedyy: A french AI made some paintings recently, give them a search they're pretty cool
[2019-02-20 23:55:17 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Cheeseyx I have to strongly disagree. strong general AI are being researched at significant and any single one of them is basically an existential threat to humans
[2019-02-20 23:55:19 UTC] valthoris: This whole topic of conversation is terrifying. Has everyone forgotten such warning shows as The Terminator or The Matrix?
[2019-02-20 23:55:30 UTC] beermanman: When I was taking an AI course in grad school, the teacher said something I found profound: All AI is just search algorithms. If you have a search space and a heuristic to evaluate it, then all AI development is just finding a more optimal way to converge on a maxima.

[2019-02-20 23:55:41 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Cheeseyx both are dangerous, I think one is an actual existential threat though
[2019-02-20 23:55:47 UTC] ipsofactotv: Painters have been grappling with "AI painting" for over 100 years. It's called a photograph. When photgraphy really became its own as a mode of picture-making, painters had to rethink what it meant to paint, leading to modern and contemporary practices that are much more abstract
[2019-02-20 23:56:00 UTC] k9kroz: @Day9tv have you "explored" Azor's Gateway for this deck? Transformed it adds x mana; x = your life total..
[2019-02-20 23:56:00 UTC] gunny: The beatings continue until creativity improves
[2019-02-20 23:56:11 UTC] tin_fox: be --creative > art.jpeg
[2019-02-20 23:56:14 UTC] cheeseyx: @Count_Brennuvarg They're threatening but given what it would take for a general AI to exist is still a ways away, whereas simpler AIs are already effecting people today
[2019-02-20 23:56:39 UTC] jovo: On the topic of AI creativity, the DeepMind video of their AI learning to walk amuses the hell out of me
[2019-02-20 23:56:48 UTC] tyrus_77: @Tin_Fox let's not be creative
[2019-02-20 23:56:57 UTC] banksy_collective: @Day9tv Loving this conversation, how are AI's doing with logic?
[2019-02-20 23:57:16 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: by the time a computer can make artstuff in a way similar to human beings, we're likely going to need to treat them like us as well LUL
[2019-02-20 23:57:29 UTC] count_brennuvarg: @Cheeseyx Sure. Among all of the existential threats to humanity though, I think strong general AI is #2. Nuclear War being #1.
[2019-02-20 23:57:40 UTC] ang8811: now let's all agree to never be creative again
[2019-02-20 23:58:03 UTC] bacotaco: thats me
[2019-02-20 23:58:05 UTC] bacotaco: all the time
[2019-02-20 23:58:07 UTC] kmbrez: LUL
[2019-02-20 23:58:09 UTC] marlowe19: It’s the same way with writing. An AI writes a novel, and it sounds like it was written by a linguistically confused kindergartner. Or James Joyce.
[2019-02-20 23:58:09 UTC] tin_fox: XD
[2019-02-20 23:58:12 UTC] subssanssoda: someone like day9? LUL
[2019-02-20 23:58:16 UTC] fieldmedic4077: Every professor I ever met cohhLUL
[2019-02-20 23:58:18 UTC] count_brennuvarg: chug9
[2019-02-20 23:58:19 UTC] typhoidrat: that'd be me. either my brain or mouth works faster than the other
[2019-02-20 23:58:20 UTC] dottorelunchmeat: LUL
[2019-02-20 23:58:33 UTC] k9kroz: Isnt that what Day9 said when he won the world championship
[2019-02-20 23:58:33 UTC] cheeseyx: @Count_Brennuvarg Most dangerous if it happened, sure. But there's a whole lot of things that would basically end the world as we know it and are more likely
[2019-02-20 23:58:39 UTC] the_imperative: nope
[2019-02-20 23:58:39 UTC] ang8811: no chugs
[2019-02-20 23:58:40 UTC] kmbrez: you're fine
[2019-02-20 23:58:42 UTC] count_brennuvarg: maybe it's just me
[2019-02-20 23:58:42 UTC] pawcakes: Nah
[2019-02-20 23:58:42 UTC] subssanssoda: no
[2019-02-20 23:58:42 UTC] princemorganti: That is a skill all it self. I am often called upon to deal with techs in the office because I speak nerd
[2019-02-20 23:58:43 UTC] k9kroz: no
[2019-02-20 23:58:44 UTC] fieldmedic4077: Nope seems ok
[2019-02-20 23:58:46 UTC] dynagnat: no

[2019-02-20 23:59:08 UTC] fledgyapplehands: @day9tv I'm currently studying neuroscience, and I'm looking at trying to into programming and AI cause I think there could be some really interesting overlaps there. Do you think ai could learn anything from biology or are we not there yet?
[2019-02-20 23:59:08 UTC] fieldmedic4077: rooBonk
[2019-02-20 23:59:08 UTC] zeniph: Wouldn't a good approach for developing a creative AI to be to generate the metadata for the specific thing that identifies it (like Monet metadata), then letting the AI fill in the rest? I suppose getting the metadata might be the hardest part then?
[2019-02-20 23:59:09 UTC] count_brennuvarg: Yeah that was just my computer, but it looked exactly the same, sorry sean
[2019-02-20 23:59:13 UTC] sacriel: have you spoken to elgato themselves? I know a super-insanely useful guy that can help diagnose if its a card/setttings issue
[2019-02-20 23:59:15 UTC] nuggettou: @Day9tv I dont know if you guys talked about this but have you seen thispersondoesnotexist.com? It's a SUPER freaky website whats just generating very human looking faces. So cool
[2019-02-20 23:59:26 UTC] awakeandaware: Hi chat not sure why Im putting this here but have you ever gotten so over your daily grind that you just got up and walked out of the office. Like the emotion overpowered my fear of judgement from my coworkers.
[2019-02-20 23:59:36 UTC] subssanssoda: dayBan
