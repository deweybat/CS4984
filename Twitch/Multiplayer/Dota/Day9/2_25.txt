[2019-02-25 12:27:32 UTC] arkjz: Uuuuh
[2019-02-25 12:27:38 UTC] arkjz: Okay
[2019-02-25 12:28:10 UTC] lykrir: bellatrix la grange?
[2019-02-25 12:29:16 UTC] arkjz: can't believe i didnt get the job
[2019-02-25 12:29:29 UTC] arkjz: and then I still have to help with la grange problems :/
[2019-02-25 12:30:16 UTC] theburningsoda: :/
[2019-02-25 12:30:27 UTC] theburningsoda: Its your redeeming quality'
[2019-02-25 12:32:20 UTC] arkjz: what help do you need :o
[2019-02-25 12:33:22 UTC] theburningsoda: Assume two periods, and that gas demand in each period is given by p = 10 â€“ q, where q is gas demand and p is the gas price. Assume that unit production costs are constant and equal to 5, reserves are equal to 6, and the interest rate is 5%. The social benefits (sum of consumer and producer surplus) in period t is then given by:
[2019-02-25 12:33:55 UTC] theburningsoda: CS + PS = 10q- 0.5q^2 -5q
[2019-02-25 12:34:05 UTC] theburningsoda: a) Construct the Lagrange function for maximizing social benefits (i.e., the net present value over the two periods), and find the first order condition.
[2019-02-25 12:37:05 UTC] arkjz: hmmm
[2019-02-25 12:37:29 UTC] theburningsoda: /me hmmms in norwegian
[2019-02-25 12:38:07 UTC] arkjz: first order condition is just setting up the partial derivatives I think if I remember correctly
[2019-02-25 12:38:30 UTC] theburningsoda: yeah i think so too
[2019-02-25 12:38:30 UTC] arkjz: And then set up the equations of y, x and delta = 0
[2019-02-25 12:38:34 UTC] theburningsoda: /me watched many Khan Academy
[2019-02-25 12:40:14 UTC] arkjz: I haven't really done these types of la grange functions LUL
[2019-02-25 12:40:21 UTC] arkjz: but generally just
[2019-02-25 12:40:41 UTC] theburningsoda: :D
[2019-02-25 12:42:05 UTC] arkjz: fx'(x,y) - delta gx'(x,y) = 0
[2019-02-25 12:42:16 UTC] arkjz: and same with y
[2019-02-25 12:42:35 UTC] arkjz: and also Fdelta' (x,y) = g(x,y) - C = 0
[2019-02-25 12:42:44 UTC] arkjz: And then you rearrange and combine like this
[2019-02-25 12:43:14 UTC] arkjz: fx'(x,y)/fy'(x,y) = gx'(x,y)/gy'(x,y)
[2019-02-25 12:43:25 UTC] arkjz: and then you just solve it from there
[2019-02-25 12:43:53 UTC] theburningsoda: <3
[2019-02-25 12:45:52 UTC] arkjz: but yeah I dunno how you're supposed to use the reserves and interest rate LUL
[2019-02-25 12:46:38 UTC] arkjz: we never did that because we're special and we usually don't combine CS + PS questions with lagrange questions :p
[2019-02-25 12:50:22 UTC] theburningsoda: hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2019-02-25 12:50:26 UTC] theburningsoda: very well then
[2019-02-25 12:52:04 UTC] theburningsoda: I dont know anyone in this class NotLikeThis
[2019-02-25 12:52:58 UTC] arkjz: uuuh
[2019-02-25 12:53:14 UTC] arkjz: I think you should start with setting CS = PS
[2019-02-25 12:53:49 UTC] arkjz: since CS + PS is the integrated function of both the consumer surplus and the producer surplus you can find out the supply function by deriving the part that is not the supply function
[2019-02-25 12:54:25 UTC] arkjz: oh I mean setting the Supply function = Demand function
[2019-02-25 12:54:53 UTC] arkjz: and cs + ps is the integrated function of supply and demand
[2019-02-25 12:55:00 UTC] arkjz: remove the part that is supply and solve for demand
[2019-02-25 12:55:11 UTC] arkjz: and set them equal to find equilibrium
[2019-02-25 12:56:37 UTC] theburningsoda: Hmmmmmmmmmmm
[2019-02-25 13:01:07 UTC] arkjz: I haven't done that stuff in over a year though so don't trust me LUL
[2019-02-25 13:01:12 UTC] theburningsoda: oh i think i know
[2019-02-25 13:01:16 UTC] arkjz: Learning for life :)
[2019-02-25 13:01:28 UTC] theburningsoda: We are looking at whether we should produce in period 1 or 2
[2019-02-25 13:01:39 UTC] theburningsoda: and using the interest rate to compare the prices
[2019-02-25 13:01:53 UTC] theburningsoda: Learning for life Kappa
[2019-02-25 13:02:06 UTC] arkjz: does the interest rate change?
[2019-02-25 13:02:12 UTC] theburningsoda: No, its 5%
[2019-02-25 13:02:32 UTC] theburningsoda: But the net present value of the resource will have to change
[2019-02-25 13:03:21 UTC] theburningsoda: we are looking into whether oil companies should produce all the oil at once, of gamble on saving it for the future since it might be worth more
[2019-02-25 13:03:57 UTC] theburningsoda: "a) Construct the Lagrange function for maximizing social benefits (i.e., the net present value over the two periods), and find the first order condition. b) Find an expression for the relationship between production in the two periods. c) Calculate the production and the price in the two periods. Hint: Remember that the sum of production in the two periods must be equal to the reserves."
[2019-02-25 13:04:00 UTC] arkjz: Oh and you have to use lagrange? Because real options would otherwise be pretty good for that
[2019-02-25 13:10:43 UTC] theburningsoda: wait shit
[2019-02-25 13:10:51 UTC] theburningsoda: we had a presentation in this xD
[2019-02-25 13:15:30 UTC] arkjz: what's tbe course called?
[2019-02-25 13:15:36 UTC] theburningsoda: Energy Economics
[2019-02-25 13:15:58 UTC] theburningsoda: yeah the constraint is Prod_period1 + Prod_period2 = reserves
[2019-02-25 13:18:33 UTC] arkjz: Well I don't know a lot about that LUL I'm in finance you know, not corporate
[2019-02-25 13:19:59 UTC] theburningsoda: theres a difference?
[2019-02-25 13:20:10 UTC] lykrir: new john oliver *o*
[2019-02-25 13:21:16 UTC] arkjz: Yeah we mostly just talk about mad gains on the stock market and snort coke
[2019-02-25 13:21:21 UTC] arkjz: we don't actually do anything
[2019-02-25 13:24:24 UTC] theburningsoda: ah ok
[2019-02-25 13:25:36 UTC] arkjz: no but we'd probably construct it as a binomial option where the cutoff is that the price falls below 1.05 and then get a price for that option
[2019-02-25 13:35:43 UTC] arkjz: I'm siiiiiiiiiiick

[2019-02-25 15:58:29 UTC] theburningsoda: i want to not choose my friend

[2019-02-25 16:07:01 UTC] pumpnineteen: wold she be your underling?
[2019-02-25 16:07:08 UTC] theburningsoda: yes, my assistant
[2019-02-25 16:07:12 UTC] pumpnineteen: because if so, it's a no-no

[2019-02-25 16:08:31 UTC] theburningsoda: its a real structure
[2019-02-25 16:08:33 UTC] theburningsoda: but no money LUL
[2019-02-25 16:09:48 UTC] brassraven: no but in business that is a huge no no because it brings a huge legal risk

[2019-02-25 16:10:34 UTC] pumpnineteen: well, if you fuk someone you have power over, it is usually considered statutory rape

[2019-02-25 21:22:45 UTC] theburningsoda: or something
[2019-02-25 21:22:52 UTC] theburningsoda: I havent quite understood it yet
[2019-02-25 21:23:07 UTC] theburningsoda: something about residual demand
[2019-02-25 21:23:07 UTC] mathanw: you mean an oligopoly?
[2019-02-25 21:23:25 UTC] theburningsoda: err maybe
[2019-02-25 21:23:35 UTC] arkjz: it's not so difficult to understand, if you imagine a supply and demand curve
[2019-02-25 21:23:46 UTC] arkjz: and you move the supply to the left or the right
[2019-02-25 21:23:56 UTC] arkjz: then the price will move
[2019-02-25 21:23:57 UTC] theburningsoda: yeah?
[2019-02-25 21:24:17 UTC] arkjz: if they restrict oil supply the price increases
[2019-02-25 21:24:20 UTC] arkjz: and also the opposite
[2019-02-25 21:24:41 UTC] mathanw: or is it duopoly and residual demand?
[2019-02-25 21:24:48 UTC] mathanw: like if you have one company having a monopoly?
[2019-02-25 21:24:53 UTC] mathanw: and another company enters the market?
[2019-02-25 21:24:58 UTC] mathanw: they split the market shares but the price doesnt move?
[2019-02-25 21:27:54 UTC] theburningsoda: errr what ark said i think
[2019-02-25 21:30:21 UTC] arkjz: I try to restrict the supply to my penis but prices still remain low =<

[2019-02-25 21:32:19 UTC] mathanw: demand is low :(

[2019-02-25 21:33:34 UTC] theburningsoda: /me nods in confusion
[2019-02-25 21:34:25 UTC] mathanw: anyway Soda
[2019-02-25 21:34:31 UTC] mathanw: this is what i mean with national economics being retarded
[2019-02-25 21:36:08 UTC] arkjz: soda its not that hard
[2019-02-25 21:36:31 UTC] arkjz: when they become monopolists
[2019-02-25 21:36:44 UTC] arkjz: every monopoly has a twice as steep demand curve
[2019-02-25 21:37:32 UTC] arkjz: and you can lower prices so other people are priced out
[2019-02-25 21:37:35 UTC] arkjz: and then produce as a monopoly
[2019-02-25 21:38:31 UTC] arkjz: oh no wait I got it wrong
[2019-02-25 21:38:33 UTC] arkjz: BUT
[2019-02-25 21:38:40 UTC] arkjz: It's 22.38 I am not gonna do any more homework LUL
[2019-02-25 21:39:29 UTC] arkjz: I'm gonna read my book nn
