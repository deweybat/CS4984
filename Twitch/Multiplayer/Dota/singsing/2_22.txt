[2019-02-22 19:48:53 UTC] puffywiggles: Okay, so doing the math it seems Spirit Breaker with out 3 STR gain would get 60 STR on average as most games end with people being 20 on average. 3x20 = 60. 10% being the stat gain buff would mean the entire benefit behind midas is 6STR. Before it was 25% on stats, so the other side would be getting an extra item with midas, say, a Heaven Halbard giving 25str and 25% of that is also about 6. Meaning its essentially the same but swapped.
